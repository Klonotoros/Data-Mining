      "topic": "'Why are you booing?' - Furious Aspinall retains UFC title after eye poke",
      "content": [
        "Tom Aspinall's first defence of his undisputed heavyweight title ended in bitter disappointment after an accidental eye poke from Ciryl Gane left the Briton unable to continue at UFC 321 in Abu Dhabi.At the end of a competitive first round, France's Gane poked Aspinall in both eyes while attempting a punch, with the referee stopping the contest.Aspinall, 32, could be seen telling the doctor \"I can't see\" as he held a cloth to his eye, and with the Briton unable to fight on the referee deemed the bout a no-contest.The result meant Aspinall retained his title - but not in the way he wanted to and he showed his frustration in his post-fight interview as the crowd booed the outcome.\"Guys, I just got poked knuckle deep in the eyeball. Why are you booing? I can't see,\" said a crestfallen Aspinall.\"The fight was just getting going. I can hardly open my eye. Look! It was a double eye poke.\"Aspinall was taken to hospital after the fight and did not appear for the post-fight news conference.Calling the fight a no-contest means the referee deemed the foul accidental rather than intentional, which would have resulted in a disqualification.A disqualification would have gone down as a win for Aspinall. Gane was equally annoyed at the outcome and could be seen pacing around the edge of the octagon, shaking his head, as the result was announced.\"I feel sorry.

So a rematch is very interesting.\"Replays showed Gane's fingers going deep into both of Aspinall's eyes, and the Briton was in visible distress after the incident.Aspinall's frustrations after the fight also point to his bitter disappointment at how it finished and he told the referee multiple times he could not see.\"I can't make people fight.

        "\"I think it's going to be an amazing fight. I don't think it's going to go five rounds, but I think it's going to be Tom Aspinall. I think with the grappling and the strength, the power in his hands, he's a dangerous fighter.\"Prediction: Aspinall",
        "\"I'm the worst guy to give predictions - every time I give predictions I fail. But if you ask me, I think Tom Aspinall has more opportunity to win. He looks better and better. But Ciryl Gane also has the chance to put him in deep water and the last rounds. We will see because we haven't seen Aspinall in a five-round fight. \"Ciryl Gane is a good opponent for him because he can move very well, can avoid damage, and he's worked on his wrestling skills. But on paper Tom Aspinall looks much better right now.\"Prediction: Aspinall",
        "\"I think this Aspinall has so many tools, man. I've seen him fight the world's strongest man. I've seen him roll against the best Brazilian jiu-jitsu guys. And it's like... where are the holes? \"Ciryl Gane, we've seen the holes. I'm sure somebody with his calibre, he's not going to sit there and let that be a hole for long.

There is certainly the possibility that the second Tom Aspinall is able to shoot and get his hands on Ciryl Gane, it might look a lot like his [Gane's] fight against Jon Jones. \"But what's exciting is both of those possibilities are on the table and I do think Ciryl Gane is the biggest challenge for Aspinall right now because of his athleticism.\"Prediction: Neutral",

        "\"I think Tom should do it quite convincingly. Gane is a good athlete, but I think his grappling has always sort of lacked. He is a tricky striker, but Tom has a good solid base and a good team behind him. Tom should make easy work, but it's the fight business so we'll see.\"Prediction: Aspinall",
        "\"It's a tough fight. Tom is a complete fighter, but I do feel like he's fought a lot of aggressive guys, and I think Gane is a guy who's gonna do a lot of moving, he's gonna be a little more cautious, and that moving around a lot might frustrate Tom. \"First, second, third round, maybe Tom can't find Ciryl Gane, I think it's gonna be a different fight.\"Prediction: Neutral",

I'm very divided on this fight, because if we talk about domination, I think Tom Aspinall is dominating all his opponents, and he's knocking out everyone, so he's doing very, very good in the division.\"But on the other hand, we have Ciryl Gane. He is a guy that has faced tough competition that Tom Aspinall didn't face yet. And Gane has the experience to make this fight go a little bit more than one round, which is what Aspinall isn't used to.\"I'm like 50-50 on this fight, but I can see Gane using his experience and taking the belt.\"Prediction: Gane",

        "Tom Aspinall was cheered by fans as he weighed in heavier than Ciryl Gane before the pair's heavyweight title fight at UFC 321 in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.Manchester's Aspinall weighed 255lb (18st 3lb), which was 7.5lb heavier than Frenchman Gane's 247.5lb (17st 9.5lb).While the 32-year-old was serenaded by \"Tommy Aspinall\" chants throughout, Gane was greeted by boos as he stepped on the scales.The pair continued to show respect to each other during a rapid 10-second face-off, as they have throughout fight week, by ending it with a smile towards each other.Aspinall, who was pumped up in front of fans at the Etihad Arena, is making the first defence of his undisputed heavyweight title since being upgraded from interim champion in June.\"This is going to be a very special performance guys, make sure you tune in, this is big,\" he said.Gane was his usual calm self and appeared unbothered by the boos, before delivering a short message.\"Very glad to be here guys, see you Saturday, thank you,\" he said.",
        "Aspinall spent 19 months as the interim title holder, waiting for an undisputed fight with previous champion Jon Jones to materialise, before the American retired.Gane, 35, is a former UFC heavyweight interim champion but has lost twice in bouts for the undisputed belt - firstly against Francis Ngannou in 2022, and against Jones the following year.He is ranked first in the UFC's heavyweight rankings and is on a two-fight win streak, last earning a razor-thin split decision win over Alexander Volkov in December.Aspinall last fought 15 months ago when he knocked out Curtis Blaydes in the first round to retain his interim title.",
        "There's no malice between Aspinall and Gane and the pair have shown a lot of respect to each other throughout fight week.For the Briton, the contest represents an opportunity to finally move on with his career after spending months waiting on Jones.There is a feeling among pundits and fans that Gane represents the toughest test in the division, and if Aspinall can win, there is a real chance for him to go on a history-making run at heavyweight.Stipe Miocic holds the record for the most consecutive title defences in the division with three.For Gane, the bout likely represents his final chance at becoming undisputed champion after coming up short twice before.Much has been made of Aspinall prioritising training cardio in the build-up to the fight, with the expectation Gane could take it into the latter rounds.The Frenchman's footwork and elusiveness is his strength, but there is a feeling if Aspinall can close the distance, the match-up will favour the Briton.",

        "Each morning Tom Aspinall drops his kids off at school - the same school he used to go to when he was younger - before turning up at his father Andy's house which is just round the corner.It is here in the Greater Manchester town of Atherton, on a 20-minute car journey to the gym, where the magic happens.Andy has been 32-year-old Aspinall's head coach since the age of eight, providing the perfect platform for his son to flourish in becoming Britain's first UFC heavyweight champion.The pair's conversation in the car can cover a range of topics, but for the past three months they have had one focus - the best way to defeat Ciryl Gane on Saturday at UFC 321 in his first defence of his belt.\"We've had millions of hours in the car all our lives and we chat. We just construct a training session. He'll say 'I need to work on my left hand today' and I'll say 'I don't think you do',\" Andy tells BBC Sport.",
        "Andy laughs in a warm, joking manner as he tells the anecdote about Tom's left hand, suggesting they don't always agree at first on what to work on in the gym that day.But this dynamic is healthy, and constructive criticism amid an enjoyment of the sport and drive to get better is key to the Aspinalls' philosophy.It is this philosophy which has formed the bedrock of the camp to prepare for former interim champion Gane, who is likely to provide the biggest test of Aspinall's 18-fight career to date.From doing 300 sit-ups a day to eating 6,000 calories, BBC Sport takes a look at Aspinall's intense training camp.",
        "In preparation to face Gane, Aspinall and his team have made one major change compared with previous fight camps - they have prioritised cardio.\"My opponent moves really well, so I'm gonna have to keep up with him moving,\" Aspinall tells BBC Sport.\"He's very athletic. He's got great cardio so I obviously want to be able to match that or get as close to it as possible.\"Aspinall is not used to long fights in the UFC. In nine bouts eight have finished in the first round, with Aspinall having the shortest average fight length in UFC history at two minutes, two seconds.Gane's average fight length on the other hand is 14 minutes, 15 seconds, with only two of his 12 fights finishing in the first round.",
        "Masterminded by Andy, Aspinall has his own gym now, where he trains with a select group of heavyweights and light-heavyweights, including the UFC's Modestas Bukauskas and Ante Delija.There are only four to eight fighters in the gym on a given day and only two people spar at once, so Andy's attention can be focused on Aspinall.\"I've always been there in his corner,\" says Andy.\"The past four years I've done every day with him so I don't miss anything. I see everything.\"To improve Aspinall's cardio, he has been prioritising body work, which can include around 200 burpees a day, 300 sit-ups a day and numerous sets of 10 press-ups.\"It's not about moving a weight or pulling something or throwing something, it's about moving yourself, so this camp he's done a lot of that,\" explains Andy.Despite the improvements in Aspinall's cardio he would still prefer to end the contest early.\"I'd much prefer a short fight, but if I have to do a long fight, that's fine,\" says Aspinall.",
        "To supplement the extra cardio work, Aspinall has been eating over 6,000 calories a day and drinking between eight to 10 litres of water.\"This is boring - are you ready for this?\" Aspinall warns BBC Sport, before describing his strict diet.Aspinall usually eats porridge for breakfast, alongside a couple of protein shakes which include peanut butter and blueberries, which can top 1,000 calories.Before morning training he drinks eloctrolytes, and refuels afterwards with a banana and another protein shake.Lunch involves chicken, rice, yoghurt and fruit, before loading up with more protein, carbs and electrolytes in preparation for his late afternoon training session.Aspinall finishes the day with a large portion of steak, eggs and rice and polishes it off with a final protein shake.Of the 6,000 calories, Aspinall says around 2000 a day get burned off during his \"heavy\" training sessions.",
        "Aspinall prioritises sleep when he gets home after training but for Andy, this is the time when he often watches fight footage of Gane.\"Tom watches him too but he doesn't have any say in what we're going to do for eight to 12 weeks,\" says Andy.Aspinall and his team respect Gane and they know the nature of heavyweight MMA, where the tide of the fight can turn in an instant, means preparation can sometimes be thrown out of the window.\"You never know what you're doing outside of fight training, if it's working or not, until you get in the fight, and then you don't know what's going to happen in the fight,\" says Andy.\"I just think Tom's got to be trained as good as he can be and his body's got to be able to react.\"Aspinall spent 19 months as interim champion waiting for an undisputed title fight with Jon Jones to materialise before the American retired.In that time, Aspinall defended the interim title once against Curtis Blaydes, 15 months ago.Aspinall ends the interview by revealing his desire to get the heavyweight division moving again.\"I just want to be active. I think one of the things about the heavyweight champ is, they've not been very active,\" said Aspinall.\"So I would like to fight regular.

      "content": [
        "Plinio Cruz narrows his eyes and looks directly into the camera when he is asked what makes Alex Pereira different from other fighters.Cruz is Pereira's long-time coach, who has been by his side for the majority of his remarkable career.He slowly raises his finger and points at his head before answering.\"I'm not comparing him, I'm not being cocky, but this is an example. Isaac Newton years ago had ideas that the church didn't understand because he was ahead of his time,\" Cruz tells BBC Sport.\"When I first started working with Alex around 2017 he used to tell me things that only now are starting to click in my brain.\"I was coaching him without really understanding the meaning behind things, because of how far ahead he sees the game.\"Now I'm able to coach him much better because we have that connection. But a connection with an average fighter takes months - with him it took years.\"When Brazil's Pereira joined the UFC in 2021, he arrived as a two-division world champion in kickboxing promotion Glory.In just under four years since his UFC debut, he has repeated that feat, winning the middleweight and light-heavyweight belts and growing into one of the promotion's biggest stars.The 38-year-old's aura was dimmed slightly when he lost the light-heavyweight title to Russia's Magomed Ankalaev in March - but he has a shot at redemption.At UFC 320 in Las Vegas on Saturday, Pereira could reclaim that belt when he faces 33-year-old Ankalaev in a rematch.",
        "The magnitude of Pereira's achievements in the UFC in such a short space of time before defeat by Ankalaev are unheard of.It took him 736 days after his debut to become a two-division champion - the shortest span in UFC history.Of his nine wins in the organisation, seven have been by knockout, highlighting Pereira's extraordinary striking ability.Cruz remembers the first time he felt Pereira's power during a sparring session.\"Just the way he was jabbing, just the way he was touching, it was shaking my brain,\" says Cruz.\"His touch is like many guys' hardest punch. He is really strong, it's scary.\"Pereira's nickname 'Poatan' derives from the language of one of Brazil's indigenous tribes - and is a nod to his fearsome power and flawless technique.\"Poatan means stone hands. Like a stone for example is something strong, that's why I tattooed it on my hands - hands of stone,\" Pereira tells BBC Sport.\"It means a lot to me because of the indigenous culture, my ancestors, my grandparents - it means a lot to me to represent this indigenous background.\"Those people fought a lot to preserve their culture. They fought for what they believe, and for me this is the same way I do in fighting.\"",
        "Pereira grew up in a poor family in Brazil before securing one of his first jobs working in a tyre shop.It was there, influenced by his co-workers, that he developed an alcohol problem before turning to kickboxing in an effort to rid himself of addiction.\"When I started training back then I couldn't visualise success, I couldn't even visualise [making a] living from fighting,\" said Pereira.Cruz says it has been an \"honour\" to watch how the \"humble\" Pereira has grown over the years.In the UFC, Pereira has developed an intimidating reputation, where his stone-faced, emotionless stare-downs have sometimes affected opponents before they even set foot inside the octagon.Pereira pays homage to his tribal ancestors, wearing face paint and a headdress during face-offs, while Jiri Prochazka once accused him of using \"rituals, magic and shamans\" to win fights.Cruz describes Pereira as an \"introvert\" but a \"sweetheart\".\"In our inner circle he's much more loose. Yes he is quiet but if he opens up he is a sweetheart,\" says Cruz. \"He jokes around and everything but it takes time for him to open up to people.\"",
        "Pereira defended his title three times last year, headlining the landmark UFC 300 event.His star power derives from his collection of highlight-reel knockouts, but there is also a charm to Pereira, who has used his platform as one of the UFC's biggest fighters to connect with fans on social media through dancing and meet-and-greets.\"Alex not only delivers on the fighting, he's a likeable person. He's a superstar but he doesn't have that superstar vibe which people cannot reach,\" said Cruz.\"Because of his humble beginnings I think people can relate to him - and that means everything.\"When Pereira defeated Prochazka for the light-heavyweight belt in 2023, he became the ninth fighter to become a two-division champion.The seven UFC fights it took him to achieve the feat is also a record.For Cruz, Pereira's status among the all-time MMA greats is already cemented, whether he regains his title from Ankalaev or not.\"Tell me someone who's conquered two Glory belts and two UFC belts. For me he's one of the best combat sports athletes that has ever happened because of these achievements,\" said Cruz.",

The winner will receive a $500,000 (£369,000) prize. \"I'm not sat here thinking about the money.

And we give the average punter in the street, in the local gyms, the opportunity to be that guy and earn hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"",
        "Watching a Cage Warriors show feels like seeing an up-and-coming band in a sold-out, intimate venue before they break into the mainstream.Over the years people have sold out Cage Warriors shows in anticipation of seeing the next star, and an overheard conversation outside the toilets leaves little doubt who the majority are here to see in Manchester.\"Luke Riley? Yeah that's who I'm here to watch as well. My little cousin there, he's 11, he does Muay Thai and worships him,\" one fan says to another.The moment fans have waited for comes as Riley arrives to an electric reception, and he quickly justifies the hype around his budding career as he outclasses Junior before securing the finish.Boylan, who manages Riley as well as team-mates Pimblett and McCann, says the former is the most exciting young talent with whom he has ever worked.\"Take into perspective Paddy versus Conor. When Conor was with us, Conor was big but the sport wasn't big. When Paddy was with us he's selling out the Echo Arena - far bigger than Conor during his time here because the sport has grown,\" said Boylan.\"Luke's a different animal. Luke is already a polished athlete, whereas Paddy and Conor still were on their way up. \"Luke could be in the UFC and fight any guy there right now.\"",
        "Cage Warriors has formed a close relationship with the UFC, with its shows broadcast on the UFC's streaming platform Fight Pass.Riley was competing at last month's Cage Warriors 178, with the promotion's next flagship show taking part in Rome on Saturday.What is noticeable about many Cage Warriors shows is the amount of children in attendance compared to other promotions, and this is a deliberate ploy by the organisers.Many of the kids are family or friends of the fighters competing, exemplified by the party-like celebrations which greeted British bantamweight Jack Humphries' impressive win over Fabian Ufs in Manchester.\"To build talent means bringing local, grassroots gyms into events. Bringing these grassroots guys, their family, the community, the mums, the dads, the kids who are training,\" said Boylan. \"If you don't bring them in and make them part of it, you're not feeding the younger generation coming through.\"But what do Cage Warriors look for when they sign up-and-coming athletes like Humphries?\"We normally look for character. The fighting and the skillset, we can see that, but there are hundreds of fighters with skillsets. So we look for that little spark,\" said Boylan.Boylan references Britain's Joe Fields as an example, who won to extend his record to 3-0.Fields, nicknamed 'The Butcher', arrives wearing a butcher's apron. He understands a big part of building a fanbase comes from showmanship, but his victory proves he is equally adept as an athlete.\"You just saw Joe Fields, that kid's going to go far. He's got the package - he's got that spark, he's humble, respectful, well-spoken,\" added Boylan.After beating Junior, Riley celebrated by placing an imaginary phone to his ear, before asking UFC president Dana White to \"call him\".Most promotions would do everything in their power to keep hold of their biggest star, but Cage Warriors are willing to lose fighters like Riley because they are already grooming the likes of Humphries and Fields to step into his shoes.It is a system which has brought great success since Boylan took over Cage Warriors in 2010 and, if it's not broken, then why fix it?\"We make jokes all the time that we're the dream-makers, but there's a lot of truth to it too,\" said Boylan.\"Some you're like 'it would be great if we could keep them', but we know our place in the sport.
