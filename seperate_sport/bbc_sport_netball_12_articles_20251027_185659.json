London Pulse secured their first NSL title as they beat Loughborough Lightning in the Grand Final held at the O2 Arena in London.The so-called NSL 2.0 era aimed to make the competition more professional, though not every player is full-time.The NSL signing window opened on 7 July and ran until 29 August, with each club having until 5 September to make public announcements of their signings.

        "Looking back only a few years, Pitman points to negative attitudes towards players with maternal ambitions.She was reluctant to discuss her own wishes, or even the fact she had become pregnant, for fear of jeopardising her playing career.\"I like to think it's changed,\" Pitman says. \"Back then, absolutely not.\"You'd be judged by it, or if it came to contracts or recruitment, that's going to be at the forefront of coaches' minds in a high-performance environment: 'What, they want to have a baby?'\"Those conversations need to stop now. Hopefully they have stopped, but 100% back then I know I didn't want it to be common knowledge.\"At Forest, her attitude is welcoming to prospective parents.\"If you want to be a mum, that's amazing. But I want you as an athlete and you're not pregnant now - so come, I don't care,\" Pitman says.",
        "Pitman, 37, is the Diamond who became a Rose.Born in New South Wales, she won the 2011 World Cup with the Australia Diamonds before her father's English background enabled her to switch allegiances.In 2018, she helped the England Roses win Commonwealth Games gold on the Gold Coast, getting the better of Australia in the final.Pitman has travelled extensively in her netball career but has settled in Nottingham, where she has \"absolutely fallen in love with the city\".She guided Forest, in their debut season, to a creditable fifth place in the eight-team Netball Super League, and to a remarkable double over derby rivals and defending champions Loughborough Lightning.Pitman loves the \"muck-in mentality\" at Forest and works to fuel the culture.There are children around the club. Scotland international Iona Christian gave birth to son Lawrie in March 2024 before joining Forest.Pitman will often care for Lawrie while the squad are working hard in the gym.She was experiencing \"a flat day\" recently before Christian handed her Lawrie.\"He just brought me back down to earth and took the stress off me,\" Pitman says. \"It's been such breath of a fresh air. He's wonderful and everyone loves him.\"",
        "Pitman thought having a baby would \"be so easy\".She feels her body, which allowed her to achieve so much in netball, \"failed\" her when she needed it most.\"I was like, 'OK, my body allowed me to achieve everything there was to achieve in the sense of netball, but it hasn't allowed me to achieve the one thing that I really wanted',\" she says.One miscarriage came on England duty, shortly before Covid-19 triggered lockdowns.Pitman was close to the three-month pregnancy stage at which point many people share their news with friends and family.\"It was really tough,\" she recalls.A cruel twist of fate meant Pitman, who knew she was miscarrying, was selected by UK Anti-Doping for a post-match urine test.\"For people that don't know, you need to pee in a cup, and when you're miscarrying, obviously things are happening as well. I just remember looking at the team doctor, going, 'this is the worst week of my life',\" she says.Pitman urges anyone going through pregnancy loss to \"lean on the ones that you love\" rather than delay conversations.She elected to \"just put it somewhere and then deal with it later\".Eventually she told her story on social media and also spoke to BBC Sport about the toll of the lost pregnancies.Pitman found she was not alone. A wave of support followed.\"I was like, 'why do we keep this quiet?'\" she says.\"The amount of women that were like, 'oh my gosh, this has made me want to open up to my family and stuff'. It's sad, because it is quite a lonely place if you do what I did and just keep it in.\"",
        "Pitman remembers speaking with friends about whether she would choose another gold medal ahead of starting a family. The answer came easily.\"Like 100%, I want to be a mum more than anything, but it's just not on the cards for me,\" Pitman says.\"We don't know the future. The future could be bright, who knows, but that was probably the bit that I had to understand a little bit.\"Pitman gets \"goose bumps\" when she learns how other sports are helping women.WTA Tour tennis players wishing to freeze eggs or embryos, so they can start a family at a later date, will have their ranking protected in future. The tour has also introduced paid maternity leave.\"I truly hope we head down that path,\" Pitman says.Realistically, netball lacks the necessary financial resources though. The Super League relaunched in 2025 but remains semi-professional.\"Until we are able to full-time pay those girls or those women, we can't have those conversations about what maternity pay looks like and what support we can give in fertility options,\" Pitman says.For now, Pitman encourages players to back their instincts about whether to try for a baby.\"Life's too short,\" she says. \"You're old for a long period of time, so do whatever makes you happy.\"",

        "Gabby Marshall was on a spinal board in the back of a West Midlands ambulance when it dawned on her - through the fog of a second concussion in a month - that this might be the injury that would end her sporting career.On Tuesday morning she made it official.After three weeks of severe headaches and discombobulating fatigue, the 29-year-old captain of Birmingham Panthers kissed goodbye to her life in netball at a tearful team meeting, concluding there was no other choice she could have made.It was not how \"devastated\" Marshall envisaged the first year of Netball Super League's much-vaunted professional era turning out for her.Rather this, though, than a worst-case scenario further down the line.She told BBC Sport: \"I dread to think, after a rest period and recovery for this one, if I was to then step on court again and be in the same situation again.\"I dread to think of the symptoms I would have because this one has been quite scary and quite difficult.\"It's a tricky decision to come to because you never want your career to end like this.\"Marshall was concussed for the first time this season in Birmingham's opening game against Leeds Rhinos on 14 March.It left her feeling nauseous for days, but she completed return to play protocols and was feeling fine when she lined up to face leaders London Pulse on 13 April, only for a collision in the third quarter to end her game and ultimately her life as a professional athlete.Marshall was attempting to catch a pass when she collided with Pulse goalkeeper Darcie Everitt and hit the deck, the back of her head banging against the court at Worcester Arena.The match was paused for 20 minutes as Marshall was treated and taken away to hospital for checks and a CT scan.Those showed up clear, but Marshall has endured a dismal time since.She is seeing a neurological physiotherapist as she looks to lead a normal life again.\"I was quite unwell for the first 10 days or so, not really able to do very much, and I'm not back to normal yet but I'm better than I was,\" she said.She recalls being in the ambulance, helpless.\"You think, 'oh wow, I've just had one particularly big head knock and now the second one',\" said Marshall.\"I've got a medical background from studying physiotherapy at university, so I was well aware of the dangers of having two concussions quite close together.\"I've had a couple earlier in my career as well, so I was quite aware it's a very serious injury. I had an MRI yesterday.\"There's a misconception with concussions where perhaps people think it's a little bang to the head and you're going to be OK afterwards.\"Hopefully I do make a full recovery, but this one's been quite scary.\"There's been quite a lot of fairly severe headaches, intense pressure in the head, unable to look at any screens, read anything.\"I've been sleeping 12 hours at night, then I'd go and sit downstairs for 10 or 15 minutes and would fall asleep for three hours. Crazy exhaustion.\"",
        "The Mancunian, who played at centre and wing defence, is described on her Panthers profile as the team's \"beating heart\".Previously with Manchester Thunder and Severn Stars, she represented England at youth level.Injuries to both ankles waylaid her in the past, but not like the concussions.Athletes in other sports, such as football, rugby, boxing and American football, have suffered long-term damage to the brain through repeated head trauma.\"With this, you're a bit of a prisoner to your own brain. You can't read a book, or you can't go out to a coffee shop because it's too over-stimulating,\" Marshall said.\"That's the scary nature of this injury and why I've come to this decision.\"I told the girls this morning at training and it was quite emotional. I'm devastated.\"What comes next for a woman who had been all in on netball, relishing being at the domestic pinnacle of a sport that has plans for large-scale growth in the next decade?\"I don't really know,\" she said. \"I'm sure as one door closes, another will open.\"Marshall doesn't harbour any ill feeling towards Everitt, who was given a two-minute penalty following the collision.\"I've had communication with Darcie since the incident. She was going for the ball and it's one of those things. It happens,\" Marshall said.\"I was quite unlucky to be on the receiving end of two of those this season, but it's the nature of the game unfortunately.\"",
