      "topic": "Contenders flex their muscles as Packers ruin Rodgers reunion",
      "content": [
        "There were a lot of convincing wins in week eight of the NFL as teams with seemingly solid Super Bowl credentials flexed their muscles.The Indianapolis Colts lead the way after improving to 7-1, but the streaking Denver Broncos and New England Patriots are hot on their heels.Running backs had some huge days including Saquon Barkley helping the Eagles gain revenge and Breece Hall leading the New York Jets to a thrilling first win of the season.Aaron Rodgers had hoped to achieve yet another slice of history as he faced Green Bay for the first time, but his former side ended up with the last laugh.",
        "Aaron Rodgers insisted revenge was not on his mind in his first game against the Green Bay Packers, but he did have history to play for as a win would have seen him join Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Drew Brees and Brett Favre as the only quarterbacks to beat all 32 NFL teams.Instead, his replacement Jordan Love led 20 fourth-quarter points as the Packers ran out 35-25 winners for their first victory in Pittsburgh since 1970.Rodgers hopes to retire as a Packer once he calls it a day, having won four MVPs and a Super Bowl during 18 seasons at Lambeau Field - but there's no doubt his departure stung after Love was drafted as his replacement.Love showed why though with a near flawless second half, where he completed 20 straight passes, something Rodgers never managed to do, and leading four scoring drives.The Steelers need to get their defence in order if they're to challenge, but the Packers look like contenders - and the Cheeshead fans who believe in omens will be excited for the season.Their quarterback Love turns 27 in November - and Green Bay's three legends Bart Starr, Brett Favre and Rodgers all won the Super Bowl aged 27.",
        "The Colts only beat the lowly 1-7 Titans, but their 38-14 victory was their sixth game in eight scoring 30 points or more - something only great Super Bowl teams Tom Brady and Peyton Manning led at the Patriots and Broncos have managed.Daniel Jones threw another three touchdown passes, but running back Jonathan Taylor was the star as he scored his fourth touchdown hat-trick of the season.The Colts are 7-1 for the first time since 2009 and Taylor is the main reason why - leading to talk of him becoming the first running back to win the MVP since Adrian Peterson in 2012.Taylor only ran the ball 12 times but turned them into 153 rushing yards, including a brilliant 80-yard score as the Colts remained the team to beat.",
        "The Denver Broncos and New England Patriots both flexed their muscles in their fifth wins in a row with quarterbacks Bo Nix and Drake Maye continuing to shine.Nix threw four touchdown passes as the Broncos scored their most points at home since 2014 in their emphatic 44-24 win over the Dallas Cowboys.Dak Prescott and the high-powered Dallas offence can hang with anyone, their defence though can't stop anyone.Denver are 6-2 with their only two defeats coming from last-second field goals.Maye was sacked five times by Myles Garrett but overcame Cleveland's fierce defence to throw three touchdowns in another clinical display for the Patriots.He's now the only player to throw two touchdowns and have a passer rating of 135 or more in the first eight games of a season.So the Patriots stay top of the AFC East, but the Buffalo Bills remain hot on their heels after James Cook's 216 rushing yards inspired their 40-9 rout of the Carolina Panthers. Josh Allen produced another typical all action display in a record 46th game with a passing and rushing touchdown, in what was the perfect prep for next week's huge showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs.",
        "Saquon Barkley finally had a big game with a monster 150 yards rushing as the Philadelphia Eagles avenged their defeat to the New York Giants from just a couple of weeks ago.After a dodgy spell the Eagles offence finally seems to be clicking, with Jalen Hurts adding another four touchdown passes after last week's big game against the Vikings.Barkley's breakout could be the final piece of the puzzle, and although he left the game with a groin injury he said it was not serious and he has a bye next week to recover.It was a tough night for the Giants' star rookie duo as quarterback Jaxson Dart was sacked five times while Cam Skattebo's season looks over as he's set for surgery after dislocating his ankle.The Tampa Bay Buccaneers bounced back from defeat last week to join the Eagles on 6-2 as the top two teams in the NFC after they dealt with the New Orleans Saints 23-3.",
        "The New York Jets finally got their first win of the season, and they made it a memorable one as running back Breece Hall threw the game-wining touchdown after a thrlling 39-38 comeback victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.NFL teams had lost 135 games in a row when 15 points or more behind to start the fourth quarter, but the Jets made it four this season already - and by far the most unlikely.Hall had an amazing final 15 minutes, running in two touchdowns before throwing for the winner on a trick play in a crazy way for the Jets to get their first win on the board.A couple of struggling sides also managed to win just their second games of the season, with Baltimore seeing off in-form Chicago and Miami cruising to victory over inconsistent Atlanta.There was still no Lamar Jackson for the Ravens but Derrick Henry scored twice and Baltimore's defence finally showed up in a surprisingly comfortable 30-16 victory over a Bears side that had won four in a row.Considering the Dolphins had only previously beaten the Jets, the emphatic manner of their 34-10 win over the Falcons was also a big surprise, with Tua Tagovailoa throwing four touchdowns.The Houston Texans bounced out to a 16-0 lead at home to the San Francisco 49ers and never looked like losing it as they claimed just a third win of the campaign.",

        "The 2025 draft class has made a flying start to the NFL season and it's not just the top-rated rookies that have caught the eye.After week seven, this year's rookies have claimed a record number of total yards and touchdowns.Four have scored at least five touchdowns and registered more than 500 scrimmage yards - rushing and receiving combined.\"This was a draft class that was heavy on offensive and defensive linemen,\" said ESPN analyst Matt Miller.\"Maybe we're not seeing it as much from those position groups, but I think the offensive skill players are absolutely shining right now.\"Some are living up to expectations while some are surpassing them, so who are they and how have they made the transition to the big league look easy?",
        "The Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected wide receiver Emeka Egbuka with the 19th pick of this year's NFL Draft and he made an instant impact, scoring two touchdowns on his debut.Veteran receivers Mike Evans and Chris Godwin have been struggling with injury, and now Evans is out for the rest of the season, so 23-year-old Egbuka is set to remain the main outlet for Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield.\"Egbuka's been thrown into the fire a little bit, but everyone at Ohio State said he was a professional wide receiver playing college football,\" said Miller.\"As a route runner, he was precise, he was crisp, he was sharp. He was a punt returner so you knew about his toughness and his playmaking ability.\"And getting to know him in the pre-draft process, he was mature. He was a leader at Ohio State, despite never being the number one wide receiver. He never complained, he just showed up and did his job.\"Miller added that rookies like Egbuka and Tyler Warren now come into the NFL better prepared to make the step up.Warren was the 14th overall pick by the Indianapolis Colts, who are leading the way with a 6-1 record, and Warren has more receiving yards than any other tight end (439).NFL analyst Phoebe Schecter added: \"The Colts' offence has surprised a ton of people, and Warren's a bit like Brock Bowers [at the Raiders] last year, a tight end coming in, being productive and such a key piece within their offence.\"",
        "Running backs Ashton Jeanty (Las Vegas Raiders), Quinshon Judkins (Cleveland Browns) and Cam Skattebo (New York Giants) are also posting big numbers, and the impact of Judkins and Skattebo is most surprising as they were second and fourth-round picks, respectively.Schecter says that Skattebo and fellow rookie Jaxson Dart have \"totally rejuvenated\" the Giants since Dart replaced Russell Wilson as their starting quarterback.\"Sometimes it's about being in the right situation at the right time, and you can see the relationship that Dart and Skattebo have,\" she said.\"Skattebo is ferocious, he fights for every single yard, and so much of what Dart brings is belief. His confidence is phenomenal.\"It took a stunning fightback by the Denver Broncos on Sunday to deny Dart a third win from four starts.\"They have something we call swagger,\" Miller added. \"You feel the energy and they've changed how you see that franchise.\"It's not just what Dart's doing with his arm, it's what he's doing with his legs too.\"A lot of times with rookie quarterbacks, [you ask] is the game too fast for them? Is the game too big for them? It has not been for him.\"The last time New York had a quarterback from Ole Miss he won two Super Bowls. That was Eli Manning. So I think the excitement is palpable, and it's there for a reason.\"",
        "First overall pick Cam Ward is struggling with the Tennessee Titans, though, and the Jacksonville Jaguars are yet to get the best out of two-way player Travis Hunter, who they drafted second overall.The Titans are 1-6 and have sacked their head coach, but Miller says the improved form of quarterbacks Caleb Williams and Drake Maye shows \"things can turn around really quickly\".Both were top-three picks last year and had tough rookie seasons, but have led the Chicago Bears and New England Patriots to winning starts this year.\"When you're drafted as the number one pick, that means they were the NFL's worst team the year prior, so we knew there were holes on this Tennessee team,\" said Miller.\"I think you can see the frustration with the offensive line, not protecting [Ward]. There's really no run game to speak of and they're decimated at wide receiver, so this is a complete rebuild. It's going to take time.\"Let's see who the next coach is, because that can change everything. I would expect them to have a plan to utilise Cam Ward's legs as well as his arm, because that's a feature of his game that just has not been used yet.\"Hunter has been playing as a wide receiver and cornerback for the Jaguars. He has played mostly on offense so far and had his best game yet during Sunday's loss to the Los Angeles Rams at Wembley.\"They're still trying to figure out what he can handle and where they need him,\" said Schecter.\"I would suggest offense because they're desperate for a number one receiver to step up, and that could be a great opportunity for Hunter because he's magic with the ball in his hands.\"",
        "Many star rookies endure a 'sophomore slump' in their second year, but equally, many players take a year to adjust before truly fulfilling their potential.Abdul Carter was the first defensive player drafted this year, with the Giants taking the linebacker third overall.And although he has registered just 0.5 sacks so far, Schecter feels he will emerge as a game-wrecker - another reason why the future looks bright for 'Big Blue'.\"I mean, imagine Abdul Carter next year,\" she said. \"He is going to be a force to be reckoned with.\"It's not just about sacks, it's about the pressures, the quarterback hits, the hurry-ups he's creating. He's living up to the hype and he's only going to get better.\"",

        "Two European football leagues are set to step into uncharted territory after agreeing to take regular-season games abroad for the first time.Fans, players and even European football's governing body Uefa have stressed their opposition to La Liga's plan to play in Miami in December, while Serie A is set to stage a game in Perth, Australia.They will not be the first sports leagues to go global, with America's big three - the National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Football League (NFL) - having held regular-season games overseas for more than two decades.So how successful have they been, and what do NFL players, fans and teams think about international games?",
        "Since 1990, the NBA has held 40 regular-season games across four foreign countries while MLB has staged 37 in five foreign countries since 1996.Both leagues have more scheduled over the next year and Leah MacNab, NBA head of international strategy and operations, says international games have \"served as a catalyst for the continued growth of the game on a global basis\".But the growth of the NBA and MLB has been dwarfed by that of the NFL. Sunday's game at Wembley was the NFL's 54th overseas game since its first in Mexico in 2005.Although the number of global NFL fans has grown to 410 million, other sports have far more. It is just the NFL now has a business model that has proved extremely profitable, with international games contributing to that revenue.The NFL's shared income, which is distributed equally to its 32 teams, has increased from $8bn (£6bn) for 2010 to more than $23bn (£17bn) in 2024 - almost double the NBA and MLB, and triple the Premier League.That rapid growth began about 2003, when the NFL put a long-term strategy in place, with competitive overseas games seen as the best way to grow American football globally.London staged annual games from 2007 and the NFL only expanded its international series when it was confident the matches would continue to sell out.The league initially met opposition from teams because they did not want to sacrifice a home fixture, and from players because of the travel. That began to change as teams saw how popular the games were and because they were made to feel at home.Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK and Ireland, told BBC Sport the league made it clear teams \"had to have a seamless, exceptional experience when they played overseas\".And international games have been held in some of the world's most iconic, state-of-the-art stadiums, such as Wembley and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with more to come.",
        "The Jacksonville Jaguars helped the cause by agreeing to play every year at Wembley from 2013. They are the only NFL team that manages an international game themselves and keep all revenues from it.\"From a financial standpoint, it was better for us to play one game here than in Jacksonville,\" said Jaguars president Mark Lamping.\"By moving that one game, we actually make the Jaguars stronger. I think that's a good trade-off, and our [US-based] fans have come to understand the reason for it.\"The team's regular presence in London has also raised awareness of Jacksonville, helping forge business partnerships between the UK and Florida.\"It's been more successful than we anticipated,\" Lamping added. \"But this wouldn't have worked if it didn't also benefit the city of Jacksonville.\"Some fans travel from the US and Europe to attend international games, and usually 90% of the crowd is from the host country. But for Ireland's first NFL game in September, more than 30% were from the US.That shows how the dynamic at each international game is unique.",

        "Pierre Ducrey had been curious about the NFL before getting the chance to attend his first game in 2020.It was the Super Bowl in Miami, when Patrick Mahomes claimed his first NFL title with the Kansas City Chiefs.And Ducrey, who became sports director of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in July, was lucky enough to be seated next to one of the major networks' NFL commentators.\"He was off duty that day and literally talked me through the game - the tactics, the subtleties, what it takes to progress, the strategies,\" Ducrey told BBC Sport.\"I love strategy in general, so I've become an actual fan of the sport. I watch every game I can.\"In having a casual interest in American football, Ducrey was typical of many sports fans and athletes around the world. Now the IOC hopes it too gets to truly discover the sport over the next three years.That is because flag football will make its Olympic debut at Los Angeles in 2028 - and Great Britain could be one of the medal contenders.",
        "As the non-contact version of American football, flag is the most inclusive and accessible form of the sport, and is now played by more than 20 million people, across more than 100 countries.Interest has grown dramatically since it became one of five sports added to the Olympic programme for LA28, something Ducrey has witnessed at first hand during flag football clinics as part of the Games' PlayLA youth programme.\"It was obvious that young people are very keen to play, as well as men and women,\" he said. \"Every time we include a new sport - especially when it's something that is very strong in the culture of the [host] country - we are very excited.\"Flag football has all the things we look for in a new sport. It's fast and innovative, and brings a different dimension to the Games.

They ended last season well and did a good job of building upon that.",
        "New tight end Evan Engram has stepped up big and new running back JK Dobbins is a guy they believe in. He's currently fifth in the NFL for rushing yards (402) and tied-fourth for rushing touchdowns (four).I love that head coach Sean Payton has \"RUN IT!\" at the top of his playcall sheet., externalThat shows how the Broncos are a team that wants to run first, because you can do a lot off the back of that. It slows down the pass rush and keeps you in favourable down and distances.It's also helped quarterback Bo Nix, who came into the league as the 12th overall draft pick last year, throwing 29 touchdown passes – second only to Justin Herbert for the rookie record (31 in 2020).Josh Allen and Herbert have the arm strength to throw anywhere, but they don't move in the same way as Nix. He has incredible arm talent, which is different, and he is so athletic.His strengths are his mobility, being able to throw on the run, and finding different arm angles to make the pass when he rolls out of the pocket, the bootlegs. He can throw that layered pass across the middle or over the corner.For a young quarterback, at 25, he's got a lot of poise in the pocket and isn't really fazed by the blitz. He tries to avoid a sack as much as possible and is able to throw under pressure. He has a high football IQ and is very decisive.When you constantly run the ball it eats up the clock and forces the defence to be on the field for longer, and when you've got an athletic quarterback the defence has to cover the field vertically and horizontally. It can be exhausting.Nix has bitten back at Payton on the sideline sometimes and I think the coach likes that attitude, that he's such a competitor. I think it's fun for him to have a young quarterback who's kind of like play-dough. He can really build something up the way he wants to build it. I think it's a special experience for him.Payton has won a Super Bowl and now passed Bill Parcells for career NFL wins (173 - tied 14th overall). He's seen it all. I think the success Denver are having on offence is mostly down to his leadership, his play-calling, his situational awareness – and the combination with Nix helps make him what he is.You wouldn't want a better guy in your ear, to help you through some of the tougher situations and build confidence.I believe in Denver's defence, in Bo Nix's tenacity and composure. But are they good enough to go against an elite team at its best? Because that was not a Super Bowl performance by the Eagles last Sunday.Right now, I don't think the Broncos are incredible. They're working above average, which is a good place to be in their division. All they need to do is maintain this trajectory.They're really good at leaning into their strength, which is running the ball, and that's exactly what they should do against the New York Jets at Tottenham. It's going to be the JK Dobbins show, essentially.The Jets have allowed 140 rushing yards per game (sixth worst in the league), five rushing touchdowns this season (10th worst), and they're the only team yet to win a game.Since the NFL began tracking turnovers in 1933, the Jets are also the first team to be without a single takeaway through five games, which is kind of shocking when you think that their new coach Aaron Glenn was defensive co-ordinator at the Detroit Lions.",

      "topic": "Will NFL return to Dublin? Rodgers '100%' thinks so",
      "content": [
        "No sooner had the NFL circus packed up its tent and rolled out of town on Sunday than thoughts turned to whether the sporting spectacle would be returning to Dublin.The Pittsburgh Steelers held off a fourth-quarter comeback attempt from the Minnesota Vikings to secure a 24-21 victory in the first regular-season game held in Ireland.Had Kevin O'Connell's men come from 24-6 behind with 11 minutes and 21 seconds remaining, it would have been a turnaround no Vikings fan would have forgotten in a hurry. But, even before they were turned over on downs to end the game, it already felt an occasion to remember for the 74,512 in attendance.For the Steelers organisation, the game was the fulfilment of a long-held dream.Returning to Croke Park 28 years after they defeated the Chicago Bears in a pre-season fixture, a repeated theme through the week was what it all would have meant to the side's late owner Dan M Rooney, whose ancestors hailed from Newry in County Down.It remains to be seen whether Sunday's fixture was a fitting way to honour one of the NFL's first families, or the start of a regular spot in the International Series rotation.Dublin was the fourth European city to stage such a fixture following on from London, Munich and Frankfurt. Berlin and Madrid will join that list next month.Games have also been taken to Brazil and Mexico with another set for Australia next year. Asia could be next. What was once America's game is now clearly global in scope but, with such competition to play hosts, can the Emerald Isle expect a swift return?There is certainly one prominent supporter in their corner.\"100%,\" said the Steelers four-time Most Valuable Players quarterback Aaron Rodgers when asked by BBC Sport NI if Dublin deserved more games in the future.\"The whole experience was fantastic. Shout-out to the country and everybody who made this happen. Win or lose, I would have said the same thing. \"I just felt like the reception from the people here was outstanding.\"",
        "International games have been a part of the NFL calendar since 2007 and, with that loss of novelty, it is natural to assume that for some players they have now become just another game.Yet star defensive tackle Cameron Heyward revealed an appreciation of Croke Park's significance in Irish culture, outlining how the Rooney family had pressed home that the headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association [GAA] was considered \"sacred ground\" to many.Following that up with an acknowledgment of how the stadium's famous terrace, Hill 16, had been converted to a seated area for the occasion only further showed his sense of both time and place.When it was confirmed in May that the Vikings would be the Steelers' opponents, the NFL talked about creating a \"mini-Super Bowl\" in Dublin and it was a phrase that was repeated all week as events were staged throughout the city.While every inch a European capital, Dublin is not of a scale where such events get lost in the sprawl. From early morning on the day of the game, NFL jerseys felt a constant presence with the walk from the city centre to the stadium bedecked in black and gold.A Steelers home game on the schedule, it felt like one in practice too. The famous 'Terrible Towels' twirled and Styx's Renegade blared, as is customary in Pennsylvania. A hotel across from the stadium even served up Primanti Bros' sandwiches. There were plenty who clearly wanted to soak up every moment of the day. \"In most NFL stadiums there's two hours when the stadium opens and [the crowd] starts to trickle in,\" Rodgers said.\"Somebody came back in the locker room at like 11:00 and goes, 'man, there's a tonne of people out there already'. \"I was, like, 'yeah, we're not in the States anymore'. This is a different type of fan. I loved it.\"",
        "The event was not without its teething problems. The Vikings appeared to pick up a key delay-of-game penalty when quarterback Carson Wentz could not see a play clock and All-Pro wide receiver Justin Jefferson lost his footing when he seemed headed towards the end zone.Nor was everyone so taken with the event as local gridiron fans.The opening of Croke Park to sports outside those organised by the GAA has often been a thorny issue. That stance has softened in recent years, but in the weeks leading up to Sunday such traditions - as well as the money required from the government to secure the game and objections to American foreign policy - were cited in media articles as reasons why some would rather the red carpet had not been rolled out for the NFL.Then, on the morning of the game, it was reported by NFL Network that Steelers back-up quarterback Skylar Thompson had been \"jumped and robbed\" during the trip.",
        "The NFL will have to weigh up the good and bad when deciding when or if they come back to Dublin. NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson told BBC Sport NI: \"What we wanted to do was see how this went, see how this week went, see how [the game] went, and then we're going to evaluate.\"We'll work with our partners in Irish government, in Dublin City Council, and evaluate how things went from their standpoint, and we'll take a look and see what happens in the future.\"For Rodgers at least, the only downside was not having more time in the country.\"No complaints about the three days we spent,\" he said. \"Only desire is for more time with you great Irish people. That's all.\"It was a short trip, but it will be a nice flight back with hopefully a yearly return by us or two other teams.\"",

        "When the anthems play at Sunday's NFL game in Dublin, it will hit different for everyone involved.For the Irish fans who have longed for the NFL to return after a solitary pre-season game in 1997.For the league itself, which has shown reverence for being granted the opportunity to play in a historic institution such as Croke Park.For the fans and players visiting from America, who see this as a bucket-list trip.And mostly it will hit different for the Rooney family, who have brought one of the NFL's most-storied franchises to their homeland, almost 100 years after their Irish ancestors founded the Pittsburgh Steelers.\"This game is bigger than football - because of the Rooney family and because we're in Ireland,\" former Steelers player Ike Taylor told the BBC.",
        "Art Rooney's great-grandparents were among the estimated two million Irish people who emigrated to North America during the Great Famine.After leaving Newry, County Down in the 1840s, they spent time in Wales and Canada before settling in Pennsylvania.Art was born there in 1901 and went on to become a multi-sport athlete, earning an athletic scholarship. He played and managed minor league baseball and semi-pro football teams before buying an NFL franchise in 1933 for $2,500 (£1870).After initially sharing the name of Pittsburgh's baseball team - the Pirates - the football team was renamed in recognition of the city's steel industry in 1940.The Steelers struggled for decades, having a winning record in only eight out of 36 seasons before Chuck Noll became head coach in 1969.Dan Rooney, the eldest of Art's five sons, began working in the team's front office at an early age and was 36 when he became general manager and interviewed Noll.That sparked a transformation in the team's fortunes. They moved into a new stadium in 1970 and from 1975, the Steelers won four Super Bowls in six years. They won two more in 2006 and 2009, and now share the record for most Super Bowl wins with the New England Patriots.",
        "Dan Rooney was already running the Steelers' day-to-day operations before becoming president in 1975.A year later, he formed a charity with Sir Anthony O'Reilly, the former Ireland rugby player who at the time was president of Pittsburgh-based food giant HJ Heinz.Now known as the Ireland Funds, the philanthropic group has raised more than $650m (£485m) for thousands of Irish organisations around the world.And as the NFL began to expand globally, playing pre-season games overseas from 1986, Rooney pushed for a game in Ireland and succeeded in 1997, with the Steelers facing the Chicago Bears at Croke Park.He also oversaw key changes to the league while serving on several NFL committees, including the 2003 introduction of the Rooney Rule, which requires an ethnic minority candidate to be interviewed for each head coach and general manager vacancy.That year the eldest of his nine children, Art II, assumed operational control as Steelers president and from 2009 to 2012, Rooney served as the US Ambassador to Ireland, making sure he visited all 32 counties on the island of Ireland.\"The idea was to let the people know that America cared,\" he said. \"We wanted to do the right thing.\"In 2000, Rooney followed his father into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and in 2013 was inducted into the Irish American Hall of Fame.Upon his death aged 84 in 2017, Irish President Michael D Higgins said Rooney was \"deeply committed to Ireland\" and that his contributions to peace and reconciliation had left a \"real and tangible legacy\".",
        "The Steelers organisation is very much a family business for the Rooneys. Five members of the family still work in the front office, including Art II's eldest son Dan.He is currently director of business development and strategy and this week was part of a Steelers contingent that visited Newry, an hour's drive from Dublin, just across the border in Northern Ireland.\"[While I was] growing up, my grandfather and father always talked about their love for Ireland, so this is a dream come true for the Rooney family,\" he told the BBC.\"Making sure we engage with the island and its people is something my grandfather cared deeply about, and we're doing that in a big way this week.\"While back in his ancestors' hometown, Rooney announced two scholarships for local pupils via the Ireland Funds, along with grants for their schools.The team also held a flag football event in Belfast, one of many community events they have organised across the island of Ireland before Dublin becomes the sixth international city to host a regular-season NFL game.Almost one in 10 Americans have Irish heritage - including NFL executive Peter O'Reilly and Pittsburgh's new quarterback Aaron Rodgers - which is partly why more than 30,000 international visitors are expected this weekend.\"There's not another international game where that connection between the team, the owners and the country is this deep,\" said O'Reilly.\"Seeing NFL fans in Dublin and such an iconic stadium being transformed, it's really special.\"After arriving in Dublin on Friday morning, several players said team president Art Rooney II spoke to the team on Wednesday, reiterating the significance of the game and playing at Croke Park.Rodgers, a four-time MVP, added: \"This game means a lot to all of us so we want to represent the team and the Rooney legacy well.\"While Rodgers is new to the organisation, head coach Mike Tomlin has been the Steelers' head coach since 2007 and remembers their former president fondly.\"I think a lot about the late Ambassador Rooney and how fired up he would be about this trip, and how important the development of this trip was for him,\" he said.\"Man, you talk about a guy who certainly had a lot of passion for Ireland, and obviously for the Steelers, and then serving as Ambassador.

        "The Kansas City Chiefs and quarterback Patrick Mahomes are in unfamiliar territory.After being denied a Super Bowl three-peat in February, the Chiefs have lost their opening two games of the new season.It is the first time they have made an 0-2 start since 2014 - before they drafted Mahomes and their three Super Bowl wins under coach Andy Reid.There are now major questions over Kansas City's play-off hopes - as since the NFL merger in 1970, just 10.1% of teams who have made an 0-2 start have gone on to reach the post-season.Mahomes has welcomed the challenge, saying: \"When you hit adversity, it's about how you deal with it. I'm excited for the next few weeks to see who wants to be challenged, and how we can get back and really get after it.\"So, is Chiefs Kingdom crumbling or can coach Reid keep it intact?",
        "Kansas City came into the season having claimed a record 17 straight wins in one-score games – when the winning margin is eight points or fewer.But they have lost that knack, losing 27-21 in week one to the Los Angeles Chargers, their divisional rivals, and 20-17 in last Sunday's Super Bowl rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles.Ed Easton Jr, senior writer for USA Today's Chiefs Wire, told BBC Sport: \"Chris Jones has always been great at defensive tackle, but he went for a sack on [Chargers quarterback] Justin Herbert when he just had to contain him. That's really uncharacteristic, and a moment like that leads to a loss.\"Then you have Travis Kelce, as sure-handed as can be. He basically fumbles the ball [against the Eagles], it deflects off his hand and it's intercepted. It changes the whole complexion of the game because if he catches that, it's a touchdown and we're probably not having this conversation.\"So when it comes down to those moments where you have to make big plays, they just haven't done it in these first two games.\"Poor discipline and a lack of key personnel have also been factors in Kansas City's slow start.Rashee Rice is serving a six-game suspension and fellow receiver Xavier Worthy dislocated a shoulder on the Chiefs' first drive of the season, while Kristian Fulton and now Mike Danna are injured on defence.\"The penalties have been racking up, a lot of them on right tackle Jawaan Taylor, who for the most part has been a disappointment since signing [in 2023],\" Easton Jr added.\"Going through training camp and pre-season, Worthy was a part of so many more [offensive] schemes this year than last, so losing him threw them off. They really couldn't get some flow against the Chargers until the second half and Tyquan Thornton's not used to being a number one receiver.\"",

        "This summer, 21-year-old Sam Fenton became the first British player to join a Division One college team in the United States as a quarterback.Given he only began playing the sport seven years ago, his journey to the elite level of US college sport is remarkable.Fenton got his first glimpse of American football watching a docuseries and confessed the sport \"didn't seem real\" to him.But the Londoner was intrigued enough to take up a game that has now become the central part of his life as he pursues a professional career in America.If leaving home was hard, the next challenge will be even tougher - carry on learning his craft, win a starting spot at the University of South Florida (USF) and impress enough in his time at college to be selected by an NFL team in the yearly draft.\"This is the hardest position in sports, that's what I believe,\" Fenton told BBC Sport.\"The pressure's what I love.

      "content": [
        "NFL 2025 seasonDates: 4 September 2025 - 8 February 2026BBC coverage: The Whole 10 Yards every Tuesday on the BBC website and iPlayer. Live text coverage every Sunday on BBC Sport website and app, and live radio commentary of selected games on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, with Philadelphia Eagles at Kansas City Chiefs this Sunday (from 21:00 BST)",
        "It's week two of the NFL season and after two thrilling games won by the Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers last week, we now have a Super Bowl rematch. The NFL just knows how to create these match-ups.The Kansas City Chiefs host the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday and this is going to be very interesting because it's definitely a revenge game. The Eagles beat the Chiefs 40-22 in the Super Bowl and nullified them till late in the third quarter.I think the biggest difference between the two teams is their roster. You look at the Eagles, they have Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, AJ Brown. You can keep listing all these great players, and I just don't know who the Chiefs have any more. It's Patrick Mahomes... then what is that supporting cast?Rashee Rice is suspended for their first six games and Xavier Worthy suffered a shoulder injury as he and Travis Kelce ran into each other in last week's defeat by the Los Angeles Chargers in Brazil.That leaves Hollywood Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster as the main receivers, which puts a lot of pressure on because the Chiefs' run game has not been terrific at all.The Chargers game was very much the Mahomes show. At one point, he had more carries than anybody else on the field. He put his body on the line multiple times - those hits add up, and you don't want to see your superstar quarterback risking his health so early in the season.Mahomes had six scrambles and the Chiefs only ran it 11 other times. Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt combined for 41 yards with 10 of those carries, and that's just not sustainable.After the Eagles, the Chiefs face the New York Giants and then the Baltimore Ravens so, realistically, they could have a 1-3 record after four weeks.Baltimore is a huge game and with the Ravens losing to the Bills last week, they're going to have a lot to prove as well, to show that they want to be on top.The Eagles have a tough run defence, and the Giants have a good defence too, so I think that will be telling, to see how the Chiefs are able to run the ball. These two games stacked together, the Chiefs almost have to think about how they are going to prepare themselves to ensure they're firing on all cylinders for the Ravens.Last year, the Chiefs won so many one-score games, and they're going to have to be much better to do that again. They may be out for revenge against the Eagles but I don't think they have it in them... yet.Rashee Rice is a huge part of their offensive scheme and, without Worthy, they don't have any deep threat either so, I hate to say it, but I really struggle to see what they'll be able to do. I don't see what their answers are right now.In the off-season, the Chiefs lost Joe Thuney, who was huge for them on defence, but they did draft a left tackle in the first round, Josh Simmons, to help protect Mahomes more, and brought in another offensive tackle in Jaylon Moore, so they are doing the right things to create strength on the offensive line.They need to because the AFC West is the toughest it's been in a long time - none of it is given this year. The Chargers beat the Chiefs, the Las Vegas Raiders have got better and Bo Nix has only got stronger with the Denver Broncos.I still think the Chiefs will make the play-offs but if they carry on like this, I would be concerned.",
        "When Mahomes scrambled against the Chargers, there was nowhere for him to go, whereas in the Eagles' win over the Dallas Cowboys, Jalen Hurts was in control.The Eagles quarterback could run the ball when he wants to, when he's able to make something happen. He was not forced into a situation where he has to run it, and both he and Saquon Barkley did a fantastic job on the ground. Hurts had two rushing touchdowns and Barkley had the other.Hurts just knows the timing and how to attack a defence. Then you look at the receivers the Eagles have - AJ Brown, DeVonta Smith, Dallas Goedert, Jahan Dotson. There's just so many more options, whereas it feels very condensed for the Chiefs.You have to look at what Eagles general manager Howie Roseman continues to do with his teams. Every time someone zigs, he zags. He's always thinking ahead.Even though they lost starting right guard Mekhi Becton and released a couple of other players, I feel like they've got even better.They were still able to add 10 talented rookies from the draft, Barkley signed a contract extension and they have just traded for running back Tank Bigsby.They've also got one of the younger defensive corps. Jalen Carter wasn't even in the game against the Cowboys after his spitting incident and the Eagles still had a pretty dominant win.When you get to a Super Bowl, of course the brain drain occurs. Offensive co-ordinator Kellen Moore has become the New Orleans head coach, but Kevin Patullo has been promoted from passing game coordinator and was also Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni's assistant, so he already understands a lot about that role.This team has done such a great job in the off-season in so many facets – on the field, off the field, front office – so I think they can definitely make it back to the Super Bowl.But I can't say they're going to win it because of the Bills. That comeback against the Ravens last week... once you've done something like that, you feel like you can achieve anything as a team, and they'll aim to carry that standard. So I think Bills-Eagles for the Super Bowl. And the Bills had better win it to cap their Highmark Stadium farewell tour.

      "content": [
        "The Indianapolis Colts firmly established themselves as genuine contenders on another pulsating NFL Sunday, while the Denver Broncos staged the mother of all comebacks.The Colts lead the league but challengers are coming from all angles, with the New England Patriots continuing their resurgence and the Kansas City Chiefs firmly back in business.Jalen Hurts finally got the Philadelphia Eagles offence moving, the Green Bay Packers showed their battling qualities and the Dallas Cowboys are still the league's gunslingers.",
        "There's no denying the Colts are the real deal now as they top the NFL at 6-1 after dismantling the Chargers 38-24 in LA, with Daniel Jones banishing doubts about his flying start to the season being a flash in the pan.Running back Jonathan Taylor is a touchdown machine - scoring his third hat-trick of the season to take his total to 11 in seven games.That star power has been key in Indianapolis being top scorers in the NFL with more than 33 points a game - and their key strength is just how clinical they are in possession.They entered the game with the best points per drive stats in the league and against the Chargers scored five touchdowns and a field goal with their nine possessions.When they don't have the ball they're the third-best at forcing turnovers (11) and when they have it they rarely give it away and almost always score.The defence gives away plenty of yards but at 20 points a game is seventh best, and it all combines for a growing juggernaut that really does look tough to stop.",
        "No doubting the game of the week, with Bo Nix going bananas and leading the Denver Broncos to a mind-boggling 33-32 win over the plucky, and unlucky, New York Giants.Being shutout 19-0 after three quarters, Nix became the first quarterback to have two passing and two rushing touchdowns in a fourth quarter, with Denver's 33-point blitz the second-best in history.Even when Nix somehow got Denver in front, impressive Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart generated a response with his fourth total touchdown of the game seemingly winning it with just 37 seconds left.That was enough time for Nix to lead a field goal drive, though, and get Denver out of jail again - but they'll have to do better if they're to go far this season.",
        "The Super Bowl champions came roaring back after consecutive losses with Hurts finally opening up his shoulders to throw for 326 yards, three touchdowns and a perfect passer rating of 158.3 as the Eagles beat the Vikings 28-22.Hurts hasn't been on the same page as his receivers of late, but DeVonta Smith had a career-best 183 yards and a score while AJ Brown caught two touchdowns in a freewheeling display Eagles fans have been crying out for.There's usually a more conservative approach from Philadelphia, but with Hurts throwing for the most yards on 20-yard throws (215) in his career, it could be a sign that they're taking the handbrake off.Patrick Mahomes was also letting the ball fly in his 93rd regular-season victory, as returning receiver Rashee Rice sparked a 31-0 shutout of the rather woeful Las Vegas Raiders.Much bigger tests are to come but it's now four wins in five for the 4-3 Chiefs after a sticky start, averaging 31.5 points a game over the past four and with only the Colts more clinical in possession.The Chiefs are definitely on the up.",
        "Drake Maye will play his way into MVP contention if he continues with such poise and accuracy for the Patriots. He set a team record with a 91.3% completion rate in their win over the Titans and, when you consider it's a team that had Tom Brady at quarterback for two decades, that's quite an achievement in just his second season.The Pats are 5-2 and have won all four away games, including the past three, even though this latest one was against the Titans.Green Bay edged Arizona 27-23 but it was far from convincing - Micah Parsons had three sacks which proved decisive but Cards back-up quarterback Jacoby Brissett still got some joy against the Packers defence.They also looked a bit toothless on offence whenever Josh Jacobs wasn't on the field, so key to their progress is keeping their star running back fit moving forward.There was a fourth straight game with three touchdowns for Dak Prescott as the Dallas Cowboys again showed their attacking prowess to beat a struggling Washington, who lost Jayden Daniels with a hamstring injury.That's a massive worry for the Commanders, who had no answer to CeeDee Lamb, George Pickens and Javonte Williams who combined for 308 yards and two scores.At 3-3 Dallas could easily go on a run and with their attack could beat anyone, but they've still got a lot to prove on defence.",
        "Only the Patriots can match Chicago's four-win streak after the Bears overcame a hot-and-cold Caleb Williams to beat the struggling Saints.The Bears ran for 222 yards and two scores while the defence leads the league with 16 turnovers, after three interceptions and a fumble by Spencer Rattler - and that combination can take you a long way in the NFL.But they'll want more from Williams.The San Francisco 49ers have their injury problems but as long as they've got Christian McCaffrey they've got a chance. The Niners are now 5-2 after McCaffrey had 201 total yards and two touchdowns to beat the Atlanta Falcons 20-10.Hapless Miami proved the antidote to Cleveland's problems, as the Browns ran up 31 points to beat the Dolphins - having previously not managed more than 17 in a game.And finally the New York Jets, who benched Justin Fields during their 13-6 defeat by Carolina, have dropped to 0-7 for just the third time in their history.",

Hunter has contributed to a 4-2 start for the Jaguars, although he has yet to truly showcase his playmaking ability on both sides of the ball.Now, having travelled to England for the last of this year's London games, the stage is set for Hunter to produce a breakout performance under the Wembley arch.",
        "Two-way players have previously been steered into one position in the NFL as it was felt playing both is unsustainable.There is no blueprint for how to develop players like Hunter as no team has attempted it in the modern era, so managing his workload has been a work in progress for the Jaguars.Their approach is constantly evolving, with head coach Liam Coen saying he and his staff were even discussing tweaks to Hunter's schedule on the flight from Florida on Monday.Speaking at the team's base in Hertfordshire, Coen said: \"Every day it's a great challenge for us. His position coaches, athletic trainers, media - everybody has to be involved in the process.\"When you're working with a guy that just loves football, loves to work, loves to play, you really want to help people like that.\"I think he's somebody who'll continue to get better each week and it has been a fun challenge so far.\"Hunter has made 15 tackles and broken up two passes as a cornerback on defence, as well as making 20 catches for 197 yards as a wide receiver on offence.Quarterback Trevor Lawrence has targeted only Brian Thomas Jr more often, with only Thomas and tight end Brenton Strange having more receiving yards, but the Jags have been designing more plays where Hunter would be Lawrence's primary target.\"It's our job to make sure we're scheming him open, putting him in positions to be the number one [option] more often,\" Coen said. \"When he is, we've got to identify it and find him, and he's got to be in the right spot at the tight time.\"",
        "Hunter's biggest play so far saw him leap above two defenders to make a 44-yard catch in the week five win over the Kansas City Chiefs, and it was one which he and Lawrence had worked on multiple times after failing to connect in practice.\"There's not many guys who are willing to do that after a hard practice, run eight 50-yard routes back-to-back until we get it right,\" said Lawrence.\"He wanted to, he was the one pushing that. He's a hard worker. That type of mindset from him is great for me as a quarterback.\"Their relationship is vital. Lawrence was the first overall draft pick in 2021 and has established himself as the Jags' franchise quarterback, so the 26-year-old hopes to be throwing passes to Hunter \"for a long time\".\"There's a lot of conversations that go into each week, every gameplan, trying to get dialled in so that we are on the same page and have that chemistry,\" said Lawrence. \"That's so important for a quarterback and wide receiver.\"I'm finding more ways to get him the ball. Sometimes we might not get him as many touches as we want, the game unfolds differently, but we're consistently trying because he's so special when he gets opportunities downfield or just catches the ball underneath.\"He can make people miss [tackles] and turn five-yard passes into 25-yard gains because he's so good with the ball in his hands. He has so much talent.\"",
        "Across his first six games, Hunter has played 62.8% of the Jaguars' offensive snaps and 38.8% of defensive snaps – just over half in total.Deion Sanders also played as a cornerback and receiver, most notably during the 1996 season.He was Hunter's college coach at Colorado and Jackson State, and Sanders believes that the Jaguars are \"not using him enough\".\"I've seen it every day for three straight years,\" Sanders told the Kelce brothers' New Heights podcast. \"I know what he's capable of, and I know how you've got to take care of him.\"However, NFL analyst Ryan Clark is among those who believe the Jags should develop Hunter as a cornerback first, then gradually as a receiver.\"He will be more impactful full-time on one side than moonlighting on both,\" Clark wrote on X.Hunter played more on defence in weeks two and three. His defensive snaps were then limited in week four because of a shoulder problem, and again in week five as fit-again veteran Montaric Brown's snap count increased.After getting married in May and becoming a father in August, a big year for Hunter off the field continued as he was baptised before last Sunday's loss to Seattle.\"It means a lot,\" he said after the game. \"I'm becoming a better man, leaving my old flesh and becoming the new Travis.\"Asked on Wednesday what he hopes the 'new Travis' will be, he said: \"Just respectful, kind, always loyal to my people. Being up front and straightforward, a family person.\"In terms of on the field, Hunter knows patience is key as he aims to register his first NFL touchdown or interception on Sunday.\"I've just got to let the game come to me,\" he said. \"Coach has been trying to dial up a couple of things for me, I've just got to continue to work and have the guys trust me because I'm doing my job every time.\"",

Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds of Cincinnati Bengals v Green Bay Packers (from 21:00).",
        "Another NFL record fell on Sunday as Keenan Allen reached 1,000 receptions.Only 16 players have passed that figure, many of them bigger names than Allen, but he is now the fastest to reach 1,000 catches.The record had stood since 2006, when former Indianapolis Colts receiver Marvin Harrison reached the milestone in 167 games. Allen got there in 159.The 33-year-old is playing in his 13th season - all but one with the Los Angeles Chargers - and has never been considered an NFL superstar.But coach Phil McGeoghan and analyst Phoebe Schecter explain why every coach wants an Allen and why they believe he is a future Hall of Famer.",
        "Allen was selected by the Chargers - then based in San Diego - in the third round of the 2013 draft, but he has outlasted many of the wide receivers that were drafted after him.\"This record basically speaks to his consistency and his availability,\" said McGeoghan, who was the Chargers' wide receivers coach from 2018-2020.\"But his intelligence and his sophistication are what has allowed him to catch that number of passes over time. He's great on third down, he's one of the best chain movers in the history of the game.\"Allen currently has 11,563 receiving yards - fifth among current players, behind DeAndre Hopkins, Mike Evans, Travis Kelce and Davante Adams.Along with Tyreek Hill and Stefon Diggs, they are the six current players to have claimed more receiving touchdowns than Allen (69).Schecter said that for him to reach 1,000 receptions before them \"shows how reliable a target he is for his quarterbacks\", yet he has a smaller profile than his peers listed above and is not lauded by fans for being a \"big-time, flashy receiver\".But McGeoghan said that Allen is \"the most heralded guy that I've ever coached when it comes to the industry professionals\".He added: \"I would say that within the industry, when I go to speak at clinics and there's nothing but coaches in there, all the people want to talk about is Keenan and his route craft, his ability to separate [from defenders], his understanding of zones, his release at the line of scrimmage. He's just so refined and such a craftsman of the receiver position.\"",
        "McGeoghan has also been wide receivers coach at the Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills, and coincidentally interviewed Schecter before she interned with the Bills in 2017.Having 'good hands' is seen as an essential attribute for a receiver, which McGeoghan said \"starts with having eye discipline\".\"You're looking at the football all the way into the frame, and then you're watching it into the tuck as well when you're in practice, so that in a game, you're going to possess the ball, look at the tuck really quickly, and then get upfield north and south.\"The second component is courage because you're going to get drilled [after receiving the ball]. There's going to be a collision, so you need to have concentration to execute that fundamental of watching the football into the tuck. It requires a great amount of courage.\"Kansas City Chiefs tight end Kelce (1,026) is the only active player with more catches than Allen (1,003), with Hopkins (991) and Adams (979) not far behind.\"[Kelce and Allen] have similar skillsets, in terms of reliability for your quarterback, doing all those little details,\" said Schecter.\"You know, take that snapshot when you catch the football, it's picture perfect. And then it's time on task. How many times are you catching footballs, putting in all that detailed work?\"It's not always fun, but it becomes part of who you are so that in the moment, you come up clutch for your team.\"",
        "Hopkins, Adams and Evans have already played more games than Allen, while Diggs and Hill would need remarkable runs over their next 10-14 games to beat the record.So who else could possibly reach 1,000 receptions faster than Allen?\"You look at the receivers out there and I do feel there are some who can do it, but again, it's about how healthy you can stay and how consistent,\" said Schecter.\"Are they going to remain healthy enough to be able to keep chipping away towards that record?\"",
        "Justin Jefferson and Puka Nacua are two wide receivers who have made flying starts to their NFL careers with the Minnesota Vikings and Los Angeles Rams, respectively.\"I would say it'd be Justin Jefferson, but that's obviously quarterback dependent, it's on them being able to get him the football,\" said McGeoghan.\"And then Puka Nacua, kind of a dark horse, if Matthew [Stafford] retires and they get the right quarterback in three or four years, Puka Nacua could be a guy to watch for that record too.\"Jefferson currently has 524 catches from 82 games so even if he maintained that rate and stayed injury-free, it would take the 26-year-old another four seasons.Nacua has 236 from 33 so it would take the 24-year-old six seasons, by which time McGeoghan hopes Allen will be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\"Both those guys will still be playing five years after Keenan retires and we'll be in Canton, Ohio, celebrating his induction with a gold jacket,\" added Allen's former coach.\"This record, because of who he passed, Marvin Harrison, who is rightfully in the Hall of Fame. It kind of puts Keenan right in that discussion.\"Like, this is a Hall of Fame calibre guy. I love his humility, but I know that will matter to him and his family.\"",

      "content": [
        "The Denver Broncos produced an \"almost impossible\" defensive display to escape with a 13-11 victory against the New York Jets in London - leaving Aaron Glenn's team as the only winless side in the NFL.Denver last week got the better of Super Bowl champions Philadelphia, who went into that game as one of only two teams still unbeaten.Yet on Sunday at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, the team tipped as potential Super Bowl contenders could only labour to victory in front of 61,155 fans in the second of this year's three London games.Nate Adkins claimed the game's only touchdown at the end of the first quarter, helping the Broncos to a 10-6 lead at half-time.Defences then dominated in a nail-biting second half, which saw the Jets edge in front with their third field goal and a safety.Denver's second field goal put them back in front with five minutes remaining, before their defence stepped up in the closing stages.The Jets were struggling to get within range to attempt a potential game-winning field goal with just over a minute remaining and went for broke on 4th & 8.But they failed to earn first down as quarterback Justin Fields was sacked for the ninth and final time - he had as many sacks as pass completions - allowing the Broncos to improve their record to 4-2 while the Jets are now 0-6.\"[Our defence] turned it on,\" said Denver quarterback Bo Nix. \"Nine sacks is a lot of sacks. It's almost impossible what they did. They're an awful defence to play against, I know that from practice, so I'm not shocked.\"",
        "So far this season Denver's offence has been efficient rather than exciting. It is their defence that has truly impressed.They came into Sunday's game with 21 sacks (the most in the NFL), having conceded an average of 16.8 points per game (second fewest), and they gave Fields a torrid time at Tottenham.The Jets were restricted to just 32 yards on offence in the first half and their opening first down did not come until a minute before half-time.The Jets finally got some offence going to claim a field goal at the start of the third quarter but then had to punt on their next five possessions, before being forced to turn the ball over on downs on the decisive drive.The Broncos sacked Fields twice on that drive, giving them nine sacks overall - the team's most in one game since 1996. The fact they were spread across eight players shows the threat Denver's defence possesses.Linebacker Jonathon Cooper finished with two sacks and three quarterback hits while cornerback Pat Surtain II, last season's Defensive Player of the Year, frustrated Jets receiver Garrett Wilson and broke up two passes.\"It was honestly pretty crazy,\" said Surtain. \"It was like I was sitting back watching, like a fan. I'm covering [the receiver], it's barely one or two seconds, I look up and there's a sack. It's a pleasure to be a part of.\"In the NFL they say defence wins championships, so that bodes well for the Broncos as they aim to stop the Kansas City Chiefs topping the AFC West division for a 10th straight year.",
        "The Jets' defence looked set to struggle against Denver's run game. Broncos running back JK Dobbins came in fifth in the league for rushing yards (402) while the Jets had conceded an average of 31.4 points (second most) and 140 rushing yards per game (sixth most).The Jets also became the first team not to claim a single takeaway in their first five games of the season, since the NFL began tracking turnovers in 1933.But it was the Jets' defence and special teams unit that stepped up at Tottenham, accounting for eight of their 11 points.They ended their turnover drought with a fumble recovery on the game's very first drive before making a 72-yard kick-off return, which set up two field goals.The Jets then forced Denver to punt on five of their next six possessions and earned a safety on the other, before the Broncos could finally do some damage on the ground to earn what proved to be the game-winning field goal.It is testimony to the Jets' defence that they almost won despite earning just 82 yards on offence and -10 passing yards, as they lost 55 yards as a result of the nine sacks. It was their offensive line that was found wanting on this occasion.New head coach Glenn is getting close to his first win. Four of the Jets' six defeats have been one-score games. But he needs some semblance of an all-round team performance if they are to finally get over the hump.Glenn said that, in certain moments, Fields should have released the ball sooner.\"This is probably our best game on defence, but our passing game was non-existent,\" Glenn said. \"When you have a team that pressures that much and plays that much man coverage, sometimes you've just got to give your guys a chance to win a one-on-one.\"It's tough being close.

      "content": [
        "Minnesota Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell said his \"brain hurts\" after he and quarterback Carson Wentz masterminded a late win over the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham.Dillon Gabriel looked set for victory on his first NFL start after replacing veteran Joe Flacco as Cleveland's starting quarterback in midweek.The rookie's second touchdown pass helped the Browns into a 17-14 lead late in the third quarter and they still led by three as Minnesota got the ball back with three minutes left.But after almost fighting back in last week's 24-21 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Dublin, the Vikings again showed great character to put themselves in position to win despite playing their back-up quarterback behind a depleted offensive line.Wentz was making his third start in place of the injured JJ McCarthy and, with 25 seconds left, he found Jordan Addison in the corner of the end zone to give Minnesota a 21-17 win in the first of this year's three NFL games in London.Coach O'Connell said: \"My brain hurts right now, if I'm being honest with you, navigating that at the end.\"We had a little bit more adversity, some caused by ourselves, but we found a way to win. Our guys were just relentless.\"It was a morale-boosting victory in front of a crowd of 61,082 and also meant the Vikings avoided back-to-back defeats as they became the first NFL team to play two games in a foreign country in the same season.",
        "This Minnesota team is a credit to coach O'Connell and his staff. They have overcome one obstacle after another since he took charge in 2022 and one of the latest was 2024 first-round draft pick McCarthy (ankle) adding to their injury woes after two games this season.Another two players were sidelined last week, meaning three of the Vikings' five starters on the offensive line were out for their trip to London.Some of the fans who travelled from the US for the two-game jaunt feared the worse against arguably the NFL's meanest defence and Cleveland forced two turnovers while conceding none.Wentz was also sacked on successive drives in the final quarter, forcing the Vikings to attempt a field goal - which they missed - and then punt, yet they still prevailed.\"I'm so proud of [the offensive line], to do what they did today in a unique week over here,\" said Wentz.Minnesota dialled up a trick play to draw level in the first quarter, with running back Cam Akers stepping in at quarterback to make a touchdown pass to tight end Josh Oliver.Jordan Mason then punched in a touchdown at the start of the third quarter to put the Vikings in front for the first time and Wentz, playing for his sixth team in six seasons, showed his experience by completing nine straight passes in the game-winning drive.That saw him finish with 236 passing yards, 123 of them to star receiver Justin Jefferson, and sparked wild celebrations on the sideline as the Vikings improved their record to 3-2.\"It's a very unique group of guys in this locker room, everybody is so close,\" said 32-year-old Wentz.\"It's hard to win in this league and when you get it done in a dramatic fashion like that, it doesn't matter who you are playing, if it's week 17, the Super Bowl, week one - you have to enjoy those moments, especially the guys who stepped up like that.\"",
        "Coming into week five of the season, Cleveland's defence had conceded the fewest yards in the NFL - 222.5 per game - and were seventh for total sacks (11).As expected, they gave Wentz and his depleted offensive line a testing time for most of the afternoon, recovering two Vikings fumbles and claiming three sacks.But they were unable to get a stop on Minnesota when it mattered most, and simultaneously Cleveland's offence stopped clicking.The Browns opened the scoring with a Harold Fannin touchdown before a field goal edged them into a 10-7 lead at half-time, and a David Njoku touchdown put them back in front heading into the final quarter.They failed to add the finishing touch, though, as over their final five possessions they earned just two first downs from 17 plays.\"We need to do a better job closing out,\" said head coach Kevin Stefanski. \"That's an offensive thing, defence, special teams, coaches, players - you name it.\"The Browns now have a 1-4 record, with Sunday's defeat showing that winning the turnover battle doesn't always mean you win the game.\"At the end of the day, you've got to go out and get the win,\" said defensive end Myles Garrett. \"That's holding them to less points than you've got, and that's not guaranteed with sacks or takeaways.

      "topic": "End of a dynasty? What next for the Chiefs after Super Bowl blowout?",
      "content": [
        "The Kansas City Chiefs went into Super Bowl 59 chasing greatness, but they came out of it with serious questions over whether their dynasty years have come to a devastatingly abrupt end.It was not losing to the Philadelphia Eagles, a team widely recognised as having the most talented roster in the NFL, that was the problem, but the manner of such a one-sided blowout.The 40-22 scoreline in New Orleans flattered the Chiefs. If the game was all but over at 24-0 when Kendrick Lamar performed the half-time show, it was definitely done and dusted at 34-0 in the third quarter.Only the Eagles taking their foot off the gas enabled Patrick Mahomes to avoid the ignominy of a first Super Bowl shutout. That would have been harsh on a team that came closer than any team before them to winning three in a row.So was it just a really bad day at the office or a sign that 'Chiefs Kingdom' is crumbling?",
        "This battle was won and lost in the trenches, as so many are, with Philadelphia's defensive line bullying their opposition, leading to constant pressure on Mahomes - pressure he failed to handle.In terms of execution, Nick Sirianni's side produced their best performance of the season in the biggest game while the Chiefs saved their worst for last.Then there were the mistakes.Andy Reid's side built their season on winning 12 one-score games. That means stout defence, limiting turnovers and costly penalties, and making the most of the ball when they have it.They did the exact opposite in the Superdome on Sunday.A pair of Mahomes interceptions cost them 14 points, while penalties hurt them on Philadelphia's opening touchdown drive, erased a crucial sack on Jalen Hurts and chalked off a stunning Mahomes first-down run.Those types of errors were so unlike the Chiefs this season - and it cost them a shot at history.",
        "Philadelphia's defence was brilliant, especially up front as they sacked Mahomes six times, just one off the Super Bowl record, and had him under pressure from the first snap.It was a similar story in Mahomes' other Super Bowl loss, also a blowout against Tampa Bay, and maybe some demons from that game contributed as he had arguably the worst game of his career.Mahomes passed for a career-worst 33 yards in the first half as he failed to get the Chiefs into Philadelphia's half - and his total quarterback rating (QBR) of 11.4 was his second-worst in 133 career games.Yes, he was under constant pressure, but his decision-making was off. He was too quick to take off and run, perhaps understandably given how his offensive line was being manhandled.But his head was down, he missed some crucial throws - a possible Xavier Worthy touchdown and first-down conversion to Travis Kelce just two of them.Cutting a rabbit in the headlights figure was strange for a three-time champion and one of the best ever at the position.\"I just didn't play to my standard and I have to be better next time,\" admitted Mahomes. How he responds now could define his legacy.",
        "The Chiefs have been the dominant force in the NFL since Mahomes' first Super Bowl success in 2020 - in a league with everything set up to stop that happening it has been an impressive run.Getting so far each year means shorter off-seasons, lower draft picks and tougher fixtures - plus a huge target on your back each season.But both Mahomes and Travis Kelce had significant down years this year, with Taylor Swift's other half also now 35 and said to be mulling retirement.Head coach Reid is 66 and after a second Super Bowl blowout loss a significant rebuild could be in order - but they have some key members of the squad out of contract and money is tight in salary cap space.These things go in cycles and a 'Super Bowl window' is often mentioned as the perfect combination of established stars on manageable contracts combined with star draft picks all meshing at the right time.The Chiefs keeping that window open for this long has been special, but perhaps it is finally closing.",
        "Two Super Bowls have now been lost due to Kansas City not being able to protect Mahomes well enough. That now has to be a priority.Is the Chiefs' front office not bringing in the right draft picks and free agents? Is it a coaching blindspot on Reid's staff? These questions need answering.Mahomes was sacked and hit more times than any other season in his career, while the Chiefs now have the top two pressure rates allowed when not even being blitzed in Super Bowl history.That means the opposition can get to Mahomes without sending extra men so can still cover his receivers. It's a combination that will not only stop them winning more Super Bowls but also puts his health at risk.The Chiefs have a huge commodity at quarterback, it's time they started protecting their star asset.",
        "Steve Spagnuolo's Chiefs defence was the only bright spot as they shackled Saquon Barkley. Yes, the Eagles scored 40 points, but the Chiefs' defence had some short fields to guard after turnovers and spending so long out there, the unit did well considering. So there could be an overreaction here. After all, the Chiefs have become a winning machine under Reid and Mahomes - getting to the AFC title game in seven straight years shows you that.Even after their 31-9 hammering in Super Bowl 55, their 'rebuilding year' was a 12-5 record and overtime defeat against Joe Burrow's Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship.That was followed by one of Mahomes' most prolific seasons, a 14-3 record and the first of back-to-back Super Bowl wins in 2023 - so although this loss cuts deep, there is no need to hit the panic button just yet.Is there work to do? Absolutely. But everything we have seen so far from Reid and Mahomes suggests that is something they will really relish.It would be more of a surprise if the Chiefs were not right back in the thick of it next season.",

        "The Chiefs have been the dominant force in the NFL since Mahomes' first Super Bowl success in 2020 - in a league with everything set up to stop that happening it has been an impressive run.",
        "Getting so far each year means shorter off-seasons, lower draft picks and tougher fixtures - plus a huge target on your back each season.",
        "But both Mahomes and Travis Kelce had significant down years this year, with Taylor Swift's other half also now 35 and said to be mulling retirement.",
        "Head coach Reid is 66 and after a second Super Bowl blowout loss a significant rebuild could be in order - but they have some key members of the squad out of contract and money is tight in salary cap space.",
        "These things go in cycles and a 'Super Bowl window' is often mentioned as the perfect combination of established stars on manageable contracts combined with star draft picks all meshing at the right time.",
        "The Chiefs keeping that window open for this long has been special, but perhaps it is finally closing.",
        "Patrick Mahomes was sacked six times and hit 11 by the Eagles defence in Super Bowl 59",
        "Two Super Bowls have now been lost due to Kansas City not being able to protect Mahomes well enough. That now has to be a priority.",
        "Is the Chiefs' front office not bringing in the right draft picks and free agents? Is it a coaching blindspot on Reid's staff? These questions need answering.",
        "Mahomes was sacked and hit more times than any other season in his career, while the Chiefs now have the top two pressure rates allowed when not even being blitzed in Super Bowl history.",
        "That means the opposition can get to Mahomes without sending extra men so can still cover his receivers. It's a combination that will not only stop them winning more Super Bowls but also puts his health at risk.",
        "The Chiefs have a huge commodity at quarterback, it's time they started protecting their star asset.",
        "Steve Spagnuolo's Chiefs defence was the only bright spot as they shackled Saquon Barkley. Yes, the Eagles scored 40 points, but the Chiefs' defence had some short fields to guard after turnovers and spending so long out there, the unit did well considering.",
        "So there could be an overreaction here. After all, the Chiefs have become a winning machine under Reid and Mahomes - getting to the AFC title game in seven straight years shows you that.",
        "Even after their 31-9 hammering in Super Bowl 55, their 'rebuilding year' was a 12-5 record and overtime defeat against Joe Burrow's Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship.",
        "That was followed by one of Mahomes' most prolific seasons, a 14-3 record and the first of back-to-back Super Bowl wins in 2023 - so although this loss cuts deep, there is no need to hit the panic button just yet.",
        "Is there work to do? Absolutely. But everything we have seen so far from Reid and Mahomes suggests that is something they will really relish.",
        "It would be more of a surprise if the Chiefs were not right back in the thick of it next season.",

Perhaps too good.They were beaten 51-24 by Florida, with Kelce having just one carry. Worse was to follow when it emerged Kelce had failed a drugs test, testing positive for marijuana.Competition rules meant Kelce had to serve a one-year suspension, but his older brother Jason Kelce, who was also on the team, convinced the coaches to give him another chance.Kelce converted from a part-time quarterback to a full-time tight end, before entering the NFL draft in 2013.Some character concerns remained and he was selected later than he had hoped - 63rd overall by the Chiefs, who had just appointed Andy Reid as their new head coach.Reid already knew Jason, having drafted him two years earlier while coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, and he told him: \"You're vouching for this guy.\"",
