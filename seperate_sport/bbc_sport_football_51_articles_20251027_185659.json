      "content": [
        "Sheffield Wednesday's joint administrator says they have \"four or five\" serious bidders and the club could have new owners by the end of the year.Kris Wigfield is leading the search for new ownership after Dejphon Chansiri put the Championship club into administration on Friday.Wigfield says the Owls have to remain on the market for 28 days under EFL rules and claims they have already received concrete interest.He told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme he hopes the new owners are in place to sign new players in the January transfer window.Wigfield said: \"As always, you get a lot of interested parties that probably aren't going to meet the criteria, but within the numerous inquiries we've had, we certainly think that there are already four or five interested parties that look like the real deal.\"There are two criteria that new owners basically need to satisfy to then open dialogue and there to be an opportunity where they can make an offer.\"The first thing is they need to show the administrators that they could make the football club viable. So they've got to show that they've got sufficient funds to be able to fund it for the next few years.\"And secondly, we have to be satisfied that they will pass the EFL fit and proper persons test, and if they can satisfy both of those, then we'll start talking to them seriously.\"With Wednesday already 16 points adrift of safety after being hit by an automatic 12-point deduction for entering administration, any potential new owners will be aware they might well be buying a club heading back to League One. Indeed, further deductions could follow, with Wednesday still to face a independent disciplinary hearing over non-payment of wages dating back to last season.But, barring an unexpected delay in any such hearings, further deductions are likely to be implemented this campaign, rather than being carried into next season and deterring potential buyers.",
        "Wigfield hopes the sale process will move quickly and a group could have preferred-bidder status next month, with a view to completing the purchase of Wednesday before the end of the year.\"Due to EFL rules, we have to market the club for 28 days,\" he said. \"So it'll be at least 28 days before we're getting close to a preferred-bidder status.\"So I'm hopeful that by the end of November, if things go well, we might know who's going to buy the football club.\"Then hopefully a deal can be concluded this calendar year, so that the new owner is in for... the January transfer window, if the EFL allows the new owner to buy players.\"Wednesday fans returned in their thousands on Saturday after their previous boycott and a season's best crowd of 27,261 witnessed the 2-1 loss to Oxford at Hillsborough.Wigfield says supporters have already spent more than £500,000 on tickets and in the club shop to keep the Owls going.\"We had no money to start with, but the fans have already put in over half a million pounds since Friday through buying tickets and merchandise,\" he added.\"So the response has been incredible, but we need to keep raising money to be able to pay the wages next Friday.\"So more tickets are going on sale for the next home games today and we need the fans to keep purchasing stuff. It's quite a difficult circumstance, but that's what we need.\"",

      "topic": "How Andrews has brought about Brentford's tactical evolution",
      "content": [
        "After years of success under Thomas Frank, Keith Andrews faced a daunting task when he took over at Brentford this summer. After a 10th-placed finish last term, few felt the Bees could replicate that sort of form this season given the departures of captain Christian Norgaard and star winger Bryan Mbeumo. But Saturday's 3-2 victory against Premier League champions Liverpool lifted them into 11th, and the Bees' home record - aided by wins against Manchester United and Aston Villa - is the joint-fourth best in the top flight. Only Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham and Bournemouth have scored more than the 14 goals Brentford have in nine matches.Six of those have been scored by Igor Thiago, making him the joint-second top scorer in the division behind Erling Haaland. Andrews, in his first Premier League managerial role, has quietly gone about his business - so how has he done it?",
        "The former Republic of Ireland midfielder has overseen a tactical evolution rather than a revolution. Not one for imposing his own coaching ideology, he prefers to maximise the talent in his squad and has made a series of tweaks that he hopes will build on Frank's success.\"The one thing we have got is individual brilliance,\" said the 45-year-old.\"I think we really have that in the squad - players capable of moments. That comes from the environment, the support they get, the training model as we are big on developing players' individual qualities.\"Brentford are having less of the ball in games under Andrews, but overall their stats remain remarkably similar to when Frank was in charge.",
        "Given his background as Brentford's set-piece coach, the expectation was that his team would score more than ever from that source, but goals via set pieces are actually at the lowest level since they gained promotion to the Premier League in 2021.That is not to say it is not from a want of trying. They have had the sixth most attempts via set pieces this season, with Michael Kayode's long throws an extremely potent weapon. After Manchester City edged a 1-0 win at Gtech Community Stadium last month, matchwinner Haaland said: \"It was a tough game, and reminded me of Stoke City with Rory Delap 15 years ago!\"In their 2-0 victory at West Ham last Monday, 10 of their 22 efforts on goal came from headers, the most by a team in a Premier League game this season.",
        "Andrews' side have been hitting teams on the break, with their average number of fast breaks more than double what they were under Frank. And their four league goals on the counter-attack has already matched the tally throughout last season, with only Bournemouth scoring more so far in 2025-26. Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Kevin Schade scored a combined 50 goals last season, and while few would expect that total to be challenged this campaign there are promising signs their new-look attack might be very effective.In Saturday's brilliant win over Liverpool, Dango Ouattara, Thiago and Schade all scored in the same game for the first time.Thiago, whose first season at the club was wrecked by injury, has scored six goals to give fans hope that he will follow in the footsteps of the prolific Ivan Toney, Mbeumo and Wissa.\"His heart is huge. His spirit, his courage, the adversity he faced last year around his injury, settling into a new country and culture,\" said Andrews.\"I think what he got here was real support and a real belief in him. As a person he really settled into this club. \"I speak pretty much every day about his game and how we can improve him. He's a nightmare to play against - that's the reality of the way he plays the game with such hunger. Sometimes you have to calm him down slightly. He's proving to be a major player for us, which we thought he would be.\"Brentford have proudly never been in the bottom three at the end of a Premier League matchweek since they were promoted, a statistic Andrews has made a good start in maintaining.",

      "content": [
        "England midfielder Ella Toone says it will \"feel like a revenge game\" for Australia when the sides meet in their friendly match at Pride Park on Tuesday.The last time the two sides met England beat Australia in the 2023 Women's World Cup semi-final in Sydney.In her media conference earlier on Monday, Australia and Arsenal defender Steph Catley admitted the defeat was the \"most heartbreaking\" of her career.Toone is expecting another physical game as a result, off the back of England's 2-1 defeat by Brazil, who played with 10 players for almost 70 minutes on Saturday.\"We broke a lot of their hearts at the World Cup so it will feel like a revenge game. For us, we just want to go out there and put on a big performance,\" said Toone.\"It's difficult when you lose a game but there's another one right around the corner to put it right. We know it will be difficult. \"There are no friendlies in football. We want to win every game. We want to perform well and hopefully get the win.\"There are 11 players from the Australia squad who play for clubs in the Women's Super League - so Toone is familiar with many of the opponents. \"I think it gives you more of an insight of what those players bring on the pitch. You know the strengths and weaknesses of each player,\" she added. \"But I don't think it changes it too much. Yuu are stepping out on to the pitch to put 100% in no matter who it is.\"England manager Sarina Wiegman said both teams have moved on since the 2023 World Cup with changes to both squads.Former Arsenal boss Joe Montemurro is now in charge of the Matildas, while there are several uncapped players and new assistant coaches with the Lionesses.\"I didn't think about it. I'm just really excited we play Australia again. They are a top-level team and they will challenge us in the way we want to be,\" said Wiegman. \"Of course, it's a non-European team but so many players play against each other here in the WSL so they know each other really well. \"But no, I'm not really looking back at the World Cup semi-final. It was an incredible game [but] we have moved on and they have moved on.\"",
        "England's defeat by Brazil kickstarted the first of four friendly matches which are forming a \"homecoming series\" to celebrate their Euro 2025 victory. Several key players are missing from the squad through injury, including captain Leah Williamson, forwards Lauren Hemp and Lauren James, and midfielders Jess Park and Grace Clinton. However, there could be a boost for Wiegman with goalkeeper Hannah Hampton set to return after missing Saturday's defeat with a minor elbow injury.West Ham defender Anouk Denton has also been called up to the squad to provide extra cover as players return to full fitness and manage knocks.Of Hampton, Wiegman said: \"She's good and she's progressing really well. She has ticked all the boxes so far. There is another training session to come through but things look really good.\"We have all seen what she can bring. She is a good goalkeeper. The first task for any goalkeeper is to stop the ball going in the net, together with the team. \"But she is also very good with her feet and that long-distance kick she has. That is really her super-strength.\"England have conceded first in their last four games but Wiegman said her side have not been guilty of\"starting slowly despite finding themselves behind. \"Against Spain [in the Euros final] we started well and could have been 1-0 up. The Italy [semi-final] we could have scored one goal,\" she said.\"Against Sweden we didn't start well and then against France we started well. So I don't agree that we have slow starts but I do agree, that on Saturday we didn't start well enough and needed to be more physical. \"We will definitely do everything we can to start better on Tuesday.\"England's game against Australia will be in front of a sell-out crowd at Pride Park (19:00 GMT).The attendance at Etihad Stadium against Brazil was 37,460 after the Football Association said before the match that over 43,000 tickets had been issued. For Saturday's game,  a Premier League game in the same city clashed with the kick-off time.\"I think it's really nice,\" Wiegman said of Tuesday's match being so well supported. \"The fans have shown so much support for us here in England but also in Switzerland for the Euros,\" said Wiegman. \"It really helps us and it's one of the reasons why we go around the country. Now it's sold-out and that's incredible. We never take that for granted. \"It's also on a Tuesday evening. There will be great support again. We really appreciate it and enjoy it.

        "Turkey's football federation says it will launch disciplinary proceedings after hundreds of professional match officials were found to have betting accounts.A five-year investigation found that that 371 of 571 match officials have accounts, with 152 of those actively gambling.

Speaking to a media conference in Istanbul, the president of the Turkish football federation (TFF) Ibrahim Ethem Haciosmanoglu did not name the officials, but said the list included seven referees and 15 assistant referees from Turkey's top two divisions, as well as 36 \"classified\" referees and 94 assistants from the level below.\"If we want to bring Turkish football to the place it deserves, we have to clean up whatever dirt there is,\" Haciosmanoglu said.He added the officials responsible will be will be referred to the TFF's disciplinary board and \"face the necessary penalties\".",
        "Like players and coaches, match officials are forbidden from participating in betting activities by TFF Disciplinary Regulations, as well as those of Fifa and Uefa.Under TFF rules, they could face up to a year-long ban, while Article 27 of the Fifa Code of Ethics states that referees found to have placed bets could face a fine of 100,000 Swiss francs (£94,246) and a ban of up to three years from all football-related activities.Some of Turkey's top clubs responded, with Besiktas saying the investigation's findings \"could mark a new beginning for clean football\" while Trabzonspor called the development \"an historic opportunity to rebuild justice in Turkish football\".\"This is both shocking and deeply saddening for Turkish football,\" said Sadettin Saran, president of Fenerbahce. \"But the fact that it is coming to light is a hopeful development.\"",

For years, officials have faced fierce criticism for their performances. But this time, the issue runs far deeper, and involves far more than a few individuals.Among the numbers released by the TFF are seven elite referees qualified to officiate in the Super Lig, the country's top division.Adding to the gravity of the situation, prosecutors confirmed that an official investigation into the allegations began back in April.Many questions remain unanswered. Who are these referees? How many matches have they officiated in recent years? Were any of those matches linked to their betting activity? Did they know about each other's involvement - or even place bets on each other's games?For now, the public has few answers. The scale of the allegations has shaken confidence in the game to its core.Several football commentators in Turkey have called for league matches to be suspended until the investigation is complete, arguing that innocent referees are now unfairly caught under a cloud of suspicion.Others say this moment should accelerate calls for foreign referees to be brought in - a proposal that has surfaced repeatedly in recent years.Yet, the football calendar moves on.

      "content": [
        "Defending champions Liverpool are struggling this season through a lack of leadership, says former England striker Wayne Rooney.The Reds have lost four consecutive Premier League matches, and are in seventh place - seven points behind leaders Arsenal.Beaten 3-2 by Brentford on Saturday, Arne Slot's side were thoroughly outplayed as a disappointing defeat followed those against Crystal Palace, Chelsea and Manchester United in a worrying opening nine league games.Speaking in the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, the five-time Premier League winner said the body language of captain Virgil van Dijk and talismanic forward Mohamed Salah during Liverpool's troubled spell was a \"big concern\".\"No-one has seen this coming, it's hit them quick, it's hit them hard and I think they're struggling to find a way out of it,\" he added.",

They are the top two players in that team and if their body language is not right, that affects everyone else.\"I might be wrong on this, but if I was a Liverpool fan or the manager, that would be a big concern for me.\"",
        "In contrast to Liverpool's problems, Arsenal look to be well placed to lift the title for the first time since 2004, having finished runners-up for the past three seasons.Mikel Arteta's side have won their last four league encounters with three consecutive clean sheets, culminating in Sunday's 1-0 success over Crystal Palace.\"The squad is good enough now and I think they've had the experiences which have got them close, but I think they're ready for it,\" said Manchester United's record scorer Rooney.\"If they don't win it now, you'd probably see a change of manager.\"",
        "Rooney's former club are also enjoying a resurgence, with a 4-2 win over Brighton making it three on the trot and lifting them up to sixth place - level on points with Manchester City and one clear of Liverpool.Part of that success has been down to the form of forward Bryan Mbeumo, who has scored three of his five goals in the last two games.Rooney admitted he was not convinced when United brought him to the club in the summer for £65m from Brentford, but said the 26-year-old Cameroon international is now living up to expectations.\"His energy, his work-rate, his desire, is what you need to be a United player. I did say that I was a little bit unsure, but I think what he's shown is he belongs there,\" added Rooney.\"He's been consistent with his performances, I think that's the main thing.

      "content": [
        "Thirty-nine days, eight matches, three wins, two draws and three defeats. Exactly the same length of time as Ange Postecoglou lasted at Nottingham Forest. And yet, that period of just over a month remains arguably the most momentous in the 153-year history of non-league Kettering Town.It was exactly 20 years ago on 27 October 2005 that then Poppies owner Imraan Ladak confirmed Paul Gascoigne, the star of England's Italia 90 and Euro 96 campaigns, as the team's new manager.But by 5 December, following allegation and counter-allegation, their relationship ended in acrimony and Gascoigne plus his assistant, former Arsenal midfielder Paul Davis, were just a memory in the Northamptonshire town.The man known to the football world as 'Gazza' has not managed a team again.\"It was sad really. The club was the talk of the UK. I don't think we will ever get that sort of sustained publicity again,\" former Kettering ball boy, programme editor and now committee member Ross Patrick told BBC Sport. \"We had Chris Waddle sitting in the Beeswing [pub] on a Friday night, Garth Crooks in Rock n Bowl, [comedian] Stan Boardman in the dugout at Vauxhall Motors, Carlton Palmer at training. It was a crazy time.\"",
        "Big names were not new at Rockingham Road. Ron Atkinson cut his managerial teeth with Kettering in the early 1970s before moving on to clubs including West Brom, Manchester United, Sheffield Wednesday and Aston Villa.He was followed as player-boss by Wolves and Northern Ireland forward Derek Dougan, whose team became the first in British football to wear a sponsor's name on their shirts.A decade later, Kettering had a side including former England centre-back Dave Watson and midfielder Steve Daley, whose £1.4m move from Wolves to Manchester City in 1979 was a then English transfer record.Nothing, though, could match the fevered interest after Gascoigne was spotted a few days before his appointment - replacing Kevin Wilson - was announced. \"There had been rumours about a consortium taking over the club for a few weeks and then at a home game Gazza and Jimmy 'Five Bellies' [Gardner] as well as Imraan Ladak were present in the main stand,\" recalls season-ticket holder Iain Holliday, who first watched a Kettering game in 1968.  \"Not long after, a press conference was held at the ground and the takeover was confirmed. I was at work that day and I was excited at the prospect of Paul Gascoigne being the new manager, although I did have reservations as to how long he would last.\"Gascoigne was not the only England player mentioned in connection with the Poppies at that time.\"We heard rumours that a guy called Imraan Ladak was coming in and about all these big players - Les Ferdinand, Steve McManaman, Darren Anderton,\" former player Brett Solkhon told a recent edition of BBC Radio Northampton's Non-League Scene.\"I remember, growing up, watching Gazza in the FA Cup final [Tottenham v Nottingham Forest] when he got injured - and my first World Cup was Italia 90, how brilliant Gazza was then?\"I got a call - 'Hi Brett, it's Paul Davis here, I've got the new gaffer on the phone' - and then Gazza came on. It was a surreal moment.\"",
        "Gascoigne had \"talked a good game\" when introduced publicly as Kettering manager for the first time.\"They haven't been in the Football League in 133 years so that will be one of the main objectives, to get this team up there,\" he said.The Poppies made a winning start for their new boss, beating Droylsden 1-0 with a goal from Christian Moore. \"At the time I was a volunteer at the club doing various stuff like selling programmes and cleaning,\" said Patrick. \"I first met Gazza on the day he was appointed. Me and Dan Willis - now the kit man - skived off school to go to the club and we ended up in all the national newspapers, on the radio and even on the front cover of La Gazzetta! We were 14 at the time.\"Imraan invited me and Dan into the boardroom as his guests for their first game against Droylsden, where we met Gazza again as well as his father John and his mate Jimmy 'Five Bellies'. Gazza signed us a couple of shirts and was great with us.\"Difficulties soon arose though as Gascoigne and Davis attempted to introduce a sophisticated passing game at odds with a more direct style which was the norm in the sixth tier of the English game.\"[At] our first session with Paul Davis, we went into the directors' room to watch a video and he stuck on Germany versus Brazil. He said to us, 'This is how I want you to play' and he started pointing at the full-backs,\" recalled Solkhon. \"It was Cafu and [Roberto] Carlos running down the wings, overlapping and you've got Ronaldinho in the middle. He said, 'I don't want the ball any more than knee height off the floor' and we're like, 'Have you not seen the pitch out there and the players we're playing with?'\"It was never going to work after that first video analysis meeting.\"",
        "The situation soon became complicated with Ladak increasingly concerned about Gascoigne because of his drinking habits and his claims of boardroom interference with signings and team selection. \"I'd call it a circus - the press attention was immense, the team performances were poor, there were all sorts of antics going on at the club. It was obvious from early on that Gazza was out of his depth as a manager,\" Holliday told BBC Sport.\"The only positive thing that came out of it was the publicity that put the club on the map at the time. However, when he left it gave the club some adverse publicity, with the fall-out from the sacking and his rant [about it] on Sky Sports News.\"Fate decreed that Solkhon, who is still turning out in local non-league football for Moulton at the age of 43, would never have the chance of running onto the pitch while Gascoigne was boss, although he was able to observe him at close quarters.\"The unfortunate thing was the week before Gazza was announced as the manager, we played in a midweek FA Trophy game and I did my knee in and got taken to hospital,\" he said. \"I was in the treatment room and as Gazza never really took any training, I got to spend more time with him. It was easy to see that Gazza had his issues and illnesses etc but as a guy he would do anything for you.\" Gascoigne's sacking followed a 3-1 home defeat by Barrow after which he vowed: \"I will fight all the way. I am now looking to buy the football club.\" It never happened.\"It quickly became apparent we were better off with a man who knew the league and players - Kevin Wilson. I think we would have been promoted that year if KW had been left in charge, but I wouldn't change anything [that happened],\" says Patrick.",
        "When Gascoigne was in charge, Kettering were two promotions away from reaching the English Football League.That ambition remains, as current owner George Akhtar made clear when he took over in May 2024, but now they are a level further away.Holliday said: \"I am surprised they never made it to the Football League in the 1970s as they were well supported and well financed with John Nash as chairman.  \"However, in those days it was a voting system and the old pals' act saw league clubs close ranks and vote for their own rather than an ambitious up-and-coming club from the outside.\"I don't believe I will see us in the Football League in my lifetime. Since I have supported them they have had a rollercoaster existence - like most clubs they have had their share of promotions and relegations, as well as administration and nearly going out of existence after the ill-fated move to Nene Park in 2012.\"Recent Kettering managers have had a far lower profile than Gascoigne - but could the club ever be tempted to try something similar again? Patrick doubts it.\"I don't think you'd find Harry Kane dropping as low in the pyramid as Gazza was prepared to do,\" he said.But perhaps the final word should go to the current Kettering owner.\"Euro '96 was an incredible time, it's the first time I can remember England in a major tournament as a young boy,\" said Akhtar.\"Gazzamania was everywhere and we all wanted to be like him. For me, he is in the top four greatest English and top 10 British players of all time.\"Everybody talks about Gazza's short stint at the club and we are proud to say he is part of our history. He was magical, mercurial and somebody I would have loved to share a pitch with.\"",

        "It was almost the perfect day for Real Madrid as Xabi Alonso's side beat Barcelona 2-1 in El Clasico to go five points clear at the top of La Liga.Jude Bellingham got his first league goal and assist of the season after a difficult few months recovering from shoulder surgery.Kylian Mbappe continued his lethal form in front of goal, while Alonso's tactics in his first Clasico in the dugout worked like a charm.But then the Vinicius Jr question reared its head once more.Unhappy with being substituted in the 72nd minute, the Brazilian winger ranted as he walked straight past his manager and stormed down the tunnel, before returning to the bench several minutes later.BBC Sport spoke to Spanish football expert Guillem Balague to get his takeaways from a fiery Clasico at the Bernabeu, and whether or not Vinicius' frosty relationship with his club will ever thaw.",
        "As first Clasicos go, this wasn't a bad one for Alonso. Seven of Real's previous eight managers lost their first La Liga meeting with Barcelona.After the laissez-faire, player-orientated approach of Carlo Ancelotti failed to get results last season, Alonso's positional game-model yielded its first major result.\"He got it spot on. Real Madrid were very good, and Barcelona didn't play well because of what Real Madrid were doing,\" Balague told BBC Sport.\"Without the ball they pressed high for as long as they could, and if they were beaten, they tracked back in an organised way, everybody including Vinicius.\"They defended in two lines separated by five to 10 metres. Barcelona could not find a way through.\"The new system looks to be good news for Bellingham, who last season was essentially asked to do everything in midfield and more.On paper the 22-year-old played on the right of midfield, but in practice he had the freedom to come inside and either support Mbappe or crash the penalty area.\"By using Eduardo Camavinga in central midfield, you get more dynamism and more ways to close down the channels,\" said Balague.\"That forced them to put Bellingham on the right-hand side. I'm sure he would have been asked to keep an eye on the runs of Mbappe when he had the ball and had space, and he found him a few times. \"He was asked to get into the box and be around the edge of the box, where he is very dangerous. He also came inside to close the inside channels and make Barcelona's life very difficult.\"",
        "There's no doubting that Madridistas love Vinicius, his name was chanted on several occasions by a fervent Bernabeu crowd. But there have been countless reports in recent months that Los Blancos would consider letting him leave if the right offer were to come in.Vinicius will have one year remaining on his contract come the end of the season, but talks over a new deal have stalled.The player's reaction to being replaced with 20 minutes left to play spoke of strained relations. As Vinicius left the pitch, cameras from broadcaster DAZN picked up the Brazilian saying: \"Always me! I'm leaving the team! I'm leaving! It's better if I leave, I'm leaving.\"After storming down the tunnel, Vinicius then returned to the bench for the closing stages.But the drama did not stop there. After the full-time whistle, he had to be restrained as he attempted to confront Lamine Yamal.\"Everyone will have a go at him and rightly so, because it showed a lack of respect for Rodrygo who replaced him,\" said Balague.\"But since being a kid he has lived in a hostile world, and he feels that everyone is against him. \"That mentality is difficult to shake, especially when you feel close to being number one in the world, then the club drives the axis towards Mbappe [as the star].\"This season he's felt that the club isn't protecting him. There are stories out there, possible leaked by the club, or with the club not denying it, that they wouldn't be unhappy if someone paid 250m euros (£218m) for him and let him go. \"He feels all that, and when Alonso subbed him - fairly, because Vinicius stopped dropping back as he should - in Vinicius' head he says, 'why me, why me again?'. \"It will be difficult to build a bridge between the club and Vinicius at the moment.\"",

If the defensive line is not perfect, as it wasn't on the Mbappe goal because Alejandro Balde played him onside, they are not helped by the midfield and forwards not closing down those on the ball as well as they should.\"Lamine Yamal, tormentor-in-chief of Real last season, was kept largely in check.\"Their stars weren't at their best. Lamine doesn't feel like he's in good form, perhaps he's suffering from groin problems that don't allow him to display his talent. \"The Barcelona of a year ago that caught Mbappe offside eight times, with Lewandowski, Raphinha and Lamine playing together, is gone at the moment. \"They miss Raphinha in attack but defence as well, the intensity that he adds.\"Marcus Rashford has been a shining light for Barcelona since joining on loan from Manchester United, but on Sunday he looked blunted.\"He was trying to create danger on the left-hand side, but he found himself too often on his own and he could not beat the Madrid defence,\" added Balague.\"Barcelona attacked too quickly which meant he had to beat one, two, three defenders.\"He felt a little bit isolated and he lost possession a lot in the second half.

Everybody has become a fatalist. If it wasn't Celtic, it was Rangers.

It was just accepted, like night following day.Occasionally a pretender has exploded out of the blocks in early season, winning games, throwing shapes, threatening to upset the way of things, but they've always been cut down by the Glasgow goliaths. And now?Painfully early in the season, it's true. Only nine games played and 29 left to play, as Brendan Rodgers pointed out later, in a somewhat revealing comment about the way he sees the lay of the land. There's still time to catch up was his gist. This is new territory for the Celtic manager.",
        "The evidence of our own eyes right now is that Hearts are clearly the best team in the country. That's all we can go on. They've beaten Celtic and Rangers and have beaten them well. They're out-playing, out-scoring and out-defending everybody.They won this game not just because of the effervescence of their attack and the holy trinity of Alexandrios Kyziridis, Lawrence Shankland and Claudio Braga - goalscorers and goal creators yet again - but also in their togetherness and work-rate and absolute desire and self-belief.On a day of noise and colour, Hearts fans goaded their counterparts with their own version of the Celtic Poznan - all linking together, backs to the pitch, bouncing up and down - when Shankland made it 3-1.They did that and more. Cheering every Hearts touch for a spell, belting out 'We shall not be moved' in other moments. Their every utterance was akin to a 'is this all you've got?' message to their visitors. And, yes, that was all Celtic had.Hearts have now scored three goals in three of their last four games and in five of the nine they've played in the Premiership. Against Celtic, they beat their seasonal average shots on target (seven as against a previous average of 5.7). Celtic's Kasper Schmeichel made more saves than in any other league game this season. It wasn't a rout, but it was emphatic. It was an answer to those wondering about Hearts' capacity to live up to the pressure of their biggest game of the season. They did that - and then some.",

Not bit-parters, but big-timers, or so he hopes.There were many moments that stuck in the mind's eye. The relentless nature of the way Hearts began the game, going at Celtic's jugular in a way that only teams with true belief really can.They got their reward with a goal, Dane Murray panicking and hoofing the ball into his own net instead of making a clearance that should have been routine.Celtic put it up to them in the 15 minutes that followed. They scored and should have scored again, but didn't. They'd regret it. You can't fake confidence. You either have it or you don't. The way Hearts roared back and won was the greatest illustration of their merits we've seen so far.And a signal of Celtic's weakness. Showing Kyziridis the inside and inviting him to have a crack is a fool's errand, but that's what they did and that's how they fell behind again.Making jumpy decisions when under the cosh is not the way to survive a trial at Tynecastle, but that's what Murray did when bringing down Braga for Shankland's penalty.In the preamble, Rodgers said that he was including Murray along with Colby Donovan and Jonny Kenny because sometimes youth has no fear.

But why not? Isn't football about dreaming of what might be? They've known plenty of misery in these parts in recent times.

      "content": [
        "The sight of Erling Haaland gingerly hobbling away after having a late equaliser ruled out at Villa Park on Sunday summed up his and Manchester City's disappointing afternoon.The Norway frontman has been in prolific form this season with 24 goals for club and country approaching the end of October, but his 12-game scoring streak and City's nine-match unbeaten run ground to a halt with a stumble in the Midlands.Villa had beaten City here in December and Unai Emery's side turned the clock back to the end of 2024 by edging another victory courtesy of Matty Cash's well-struck first-half winner.Pep Guardiola's side started brightly but looked lethargic in parts and without their star striker firing, there was no goalscoring assistance being provided from any of his team-mates.In a week where he launched his YouTube channel and revealed his love for raw milk, Haaland and his team-mates went back to the north west with a sour taste in their mouths.\"We haven't scored a lot of goals this season and we have to make a step up,\" admitted Guardiola. \"Today it is difficult because they defended really well. We were there, we were close.

      "content": [
        "\"You've sold the team, now sell the club,\" chanted the Wolves fans.\"Sacked in the morning,\" they sang at manager Vitor Pereira.As soon as Zian Flemming opened the scoring for Burnley a flat Molineux threatened to turn toxic. After Lyle Foster's 95th-minute winner sealed a 3-2 win for the Clarets, it did. Fractures which have been under the surface for a number of years emerged as players and Pereira had heated discussions with fans in the South Bank - Pereira especially animated - at the end. It was the first time fans had turned on the Portuguese, who guided them to safety and drank in the local pub with them last season.Yet, executive chairman Jeff Shi and owners Fosun are regular targets with supporters upset at the running of the club, with Wolves on their fourth permanent manager in three years. The summer sales of Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri also saw Wolves lose their best players, who have not been replaced effectively.  The anger was mixed with apathy, though. Fans looking resigned to relegation and lacking the motivation to protest properly, worn down by a slow decline since Nuno Espirito Santo, who took them to a Europa League quarter-final, left in 2021. Bottom of the league and winless in their opening nine games, Wolves are stuck in a timewarp after taking 11 matches to win last season. Pereira saved them after replacing Gary O'Neil in December but as history repeats itself, how does the Portuguese save Wolves' season and his own future?",
        "It is just 38 days since Pereira signed a new three-year contract and sources have told BBC Sport he is not in immediate danger. Shi and those in charge still feel his experience will be crucial in the survival battle, having taken them from second bottom to safety last season. Although, predecessor O'Neil signed a four-year deal on the eve of last season and only lasted another four months. Domenico Teti's arrival as director of professional football in the summer is also a sign of the position of strength Pereira held at the end of last season, the pair having worked together in Saudi Arabia at Al-Shabab. There is a hesitancy to change given the amount of managers the club have gone through recently and fan reaction will not sway Shi. The fact Wolves stayed up after failing to win any of the opening 10 games in 2024-25 shows it can be done again, although it is six months since their last Premier League win. \"It's normal in football, if we win two or three games in a row everything changes,\" said Pereira in his post-match press conference. \"Two months ago they sing my name because of the work we did last season [means] we are competing in the Premier League and not in the Championship. Now they sing my name maybe to sack me.\"I'm not worried [about his job], it's not about me. It's about the team, the players. My work is to help them to come again, to be mentally strong for the next fight.\"Pereira also tried to diffuse any tension with supporters, revealing what he said to the revolting fans.\"What I said to them is we work a lot and we need to fight together,\" he said. \"I understand the frustration. When you are there for 90 minutes trying to help the team and the team gave everything on the pitch to win but, in the end, you concede a goal, I understand the frustration. \"What I must say to them is if we fight with them, united, we can win games. If not, without them, it's impossible.\"The tipping point for Pereira would come if he loses the faith and confidence of the players, which he has not done. There is an acceptance at Molineux results have not been good enough but the performance on Sunday as they fought back from 2-0 down, despite defeat, reinforced the players remain behind the manager.\"Yes, of course, all of us are,\" said striker Jorgen Strand Larsen. \"We know what we did last season. We're not blaming anyone here. Obviously, it's tough for a team with a lot of changes in the summer.\"There are a loads of new faces and it needs time to adapt. That's why I'm feel like in the last few games we're getting there.\"",
        "Wolves' start last season saw them play all of those who finished in the top eight in their opening 10 games. Their first win came with a 2-0 victory over Southampton on 9 November, which was followed by a 4-1 win at Fulham. Performances and the difficult nature of the run were mitigating circumstances which saw O'Neil keep his job until the axe fell following a run of four defeats, culminating in a late home loss to Ipswich in December. Pereira, after six straight wins in March and April, guided them to 16th to finish 17 points above the bottom three. Cunha and Ait-Nouri were then sold to Manchester United and Manchester City for a combined £93.5m and Wolves reinvested close to £100m in the summer, bringing in five players - six counting turning Strand Larsen's loan into a permanent move - from Europe but with no Premier League experience. It was felt the value was on the continent but they need time to adapt and the squad is missing the spark 15-goal Cunha and wing-back Ait-Nouri delivered. It has meant the squad is lacking the extra quality to turn draws into victories, conceding in the 86th minute to Brighton and injury-time to Tottenham to draw both games 1-1. The defeat to Burnley means they have lost to all three promoted clubs this season, beaten at home by Leeds and at Sunderland last week, with Pereira aware lessons need to be learned quickly.\"It's difficult to answer because I was not here the last season in the first games of the season,\" said Pereira, when asked if there was a deeper problem at Wolves after another winless start.\"We need to learn with the experience, especially the experience in the market, experience in the pre-season, the way that we organise these things. \"We can learn every day, even me, we can do better. I think we can do better.\"",

      "content": [
        "One swallow does not a summer make, of course, but there's an argument to suggest the first blue shoots of recovery have been sown for new Rangers head coach Danny Rohl.No-one at Ibrox will be getting carried away with Sunday's home win over Kilmarnock.Nonetheless, a few significant strands of hope do seem to be emerging from the wreckage of the club's worst start to a season in decades.",
        "Let's not underestimate the importance of the three points the German newcomer has just helped accrue. In four previous attempts under Russell Martin and interim manager Steven Smith, Rangers could not muster a Premiership win at Ibrox. Dundee, Celtic, Hearts and Dundee United all left Govan with something. At the first time of asking in the league, and under no little pressure because of the non-performance in Thursday's Europa League loss to Brann in Bergen, Rohl delivered the victory the fans demanded and craved.It was delivered with some flair, too. Three goals, two disallowed goals and a clearance off the line to name but a few of the memorable moments. The performance was far from perfect but was a clear improvement on what had gone before, however much Kilmarnock contributed to their own downfall.",

A draw at Fulham, another at home to Palace, while they lost at Newcastle and were beaten at home by West Ham.It meant the Gunners finished second for a third successive season, this time with a 10-point deficit to champions Liverpool, showing just how crucial such results are to the final outcome.What is even more impressive about Arsenal's start to the campaign is they have also played Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle United away from home and Manchester City at home - and are still four points clear at the top from Bournemouth.While they keep winning, their traditional rivals aren't faring so well. In fact, it is the first time at this stage of this season since 1992 that none of Manchester City and United, Liverpool or Chelsea are in the Premier League top four.\"It is interesting because there are some misconceptions we have and that is true with Arsenal.

      "content": [
        "Baller League CEO Felix Starck set out clear and bold plans to \"bring back football\" when he started his UK version of the six-a-side competition in early 2025.A quick glance across social media offers up polarising opinions on whether he delivered on that promise.As the German entrepreneur sat pitchside at a sold-out O2 Arena for the season-concluding Final Four event, any online negativity was drowned out by thousands of screaming children and regular interjections from an air horn.\"Most people liked it that are in our audience group, maybe the 55-year-olds didn't like it so much, but the kids like it so what do we care about the 55-year-olds?\" Starck told BBC Sport.\"What is there to hate? You don't need to watch it, you don't need to pay for it - it's free-to-air. I don't understand why people hate on something that they didn't lose a single minute or pound on.\"The first season, which ran between March and June, was broadcast via Sky Sports as well as free-to-air platforms YouTube and Twitch.There was an average of one million YouTube streams for each night of action, with 12 matchdays in all.Baller League did not respond to BBC Sport's request for their viewing figures on Sky Sports.Season two begins in the UK on 27 October with Sky set to continue their live coverage of the event.",
        "Prior to the inaugural season, Starck spoke about wanting to \"create an ecosystem\"   and there is evidence to suggest Baller League is on the right path.After 11 matchdays at London's Copper Box Arena, those \"kids\" made their way into the O2 with loyalties already forged. Swathes of the arena were filled with the green and yellow shirts of Yanited - a team managed by streamer AngryGinge - and homemade banners were draped over the railings to show support for Sharky's SDS FC.At a time when Premier League ticket prices are rising, making it difficult for working class fans to regularly attend, Baller League can offer five-hour long matchdays for £14.75.\"We're trying to democratise football and make it accessible,\" Starck said.\"I talked to 100 fans at the final and 70 or 80% of them were at their first live football game - that just shows where we are in modern-day 11-a-side football. It's not accessible to the normal fans.\"Starck has undeniably tapped into a gap in the market - blending the nation's favourite sport with entertainment.\"The biggest thing we try to measure is the quality on the pitch, if it keeps getting better then eyeballs [on the game] are going to grow, revenue is going to grow - everything is going to grow,\" Starck said.\"We are trying to bring football back to where it was, which was three kids on the street playing two against one - or five against five. Let's just play football and be connected to the base again. This is culture and sport, not a product.\"Starck is so confident in the quality of the league he has assembled that he is prepared to donate \"a million\" to the youth team of any League One club if they can beat the likes of SDS FC or Yanited in a six-a-side game, claiming they would \"get sent home\".",
        "Baller League may be doing many things right. After starting out in Germany in 2023, it expanded to the UK and is preparing to launch in the USA. But Starck conceded there is \"room for improvement in every department\".Several incidents of violence marred the opening UK season, with manager AngryGinge left with scratch marks on his neck following a fight between players from SDS and Yanited during matchday seven. The Yanited manager later said he had been \"gripped up and kicked\" while in the middle of a melee on the pitch.That incident came a week after former Premier League defender Joleon Lescott, who appeared as a guest player, was almost wrestled over the advertising hoardings during an altercation with Wembley Rangers' Domingos Pires.On matchday five, Troy Deeney was sent off for charging into a player from FC Rules the World with his forearm raised.\"We're a very soft society these days but this is sport, this is emotion,\" Starck said.\"If two roosters get in a room they are going to fight and we have 250 roosters, so they are going to fight.\"We had whole talks [after incidents], we don't discuss publicly what we did but we took measures to make sure things like this don't happen again.\"Unlike the Premier League, Baller League is not regulated by a governing body and therefore sanctions are processed by its internal disciplinary commission.Baller League took action after tensions boiled over again on the penultimate matchday of the regular season, when Trebol FC's Amine Sassi appeared to kick an opponent in the head as they lay on the floor - handing out a one-match suspension.\"Baller League upholds a strict zero-tolerance policy for this kind of behaviour and will continue to enforce it consistently,\" the organisation posted at the time., external",
        "There has been a reshuffle in the dugout for the second season, with some big-name managers dropping out.Luis Figo was the manager of Trebol FC last season but did not turn up to any events, and the Ballon d'Or winner is not involved for the new campaign.Former Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who co-managed Deportrio with pundits Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, has also left after only making a couple of appearances on the touchline as their team reached the semi-finals.Actor Idris Elba has been confirmed as the manager of new team Rukkas FC, while former England striker Daniel Sturridge has joined Richards at Deportrio and Shearer has switched allegiance to join Ian Wright at Wembley Rangers.Baller League has also introduced a three-tiered pay structure for players, with contracts ranging from £300 to £800 per game.\"We are culturally relevant after our first season in the UK. I heard people in the stadium when I went to an Arsenal game talking about Baller League,\" Starck said.\"It's a straw fire right now and the challenge is to collect enough firewood to turn this into a real fire that is sustainable, and not just hype.\"Anyone can do short-term hype, it's about being sustainable.\"",

      "topic": "'The Thomas Frank effect' - but is there more to come from Spurs?",
      "content": [
        "It's a breath of fresh air to see teams like Bournemouth and Sunderland exceeding expectations at the top of the Premier League - and I would include Tottenham in that list of over-achievers too.There has been the odd disappointing performance under Thomas Frank, especially at home, but I don't think anyone thought it would be easy for him to quickly transition this squad into a team in his image - and not many Spurs fans would have expected them to be sitting in third place now.I know there has still been some criticism from their supporters, especially with calls for more creativity in open play, and I can understand that, but sometimes you have to walk before you can run.The glaring problems they had last season were conceding too many goals and being too easy to play against, and I'm sure when Frank arrived at Tottenham he thought, 'let's fix that first'.He's done that, because if you look at their progress from the beginning of the season up until now, then one thing we can all say is that you can see the 'Thomas Frank effect'.By that I mean they are now a team that is very well organised defensively, and very good on set-pieces too.",
        "Yes, there have been times in games when they have looked a bit one-dimensional in what they are trying to do with the ball, and they have relied a lot on some magic from Mohammed Kudus to make chances out of nothing.But I am confident we will see an improvement in that attacking element of their game when some of their injured players come back, firstly Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke and, longer-term, James Maddison as well.So, while it's not been perfect so far, there is a lot of positive energy around what Frank is doing, and also a lot to look forward to.Spurs have probably got the strongest squad they have had in a while, they are picking up points without playing brilliantly, and they are sitting in a really good place in the table, with some really strong reinforcements to come in.It is still very early, but Frank has made a brilliant start in turning around a squad that had been depleted in confidence, and I feel like there is lots more to come.",
        "Supporters like their team to have an identity, and I can already see one at Spurs under Frank after less than 10 league games.At the moment they are a side which is well drilled with a tremendous work ethic and is difficult to beat, and not obsessed with playing out from the back and giving away stupid chances.I'd also say they are reasonably pragmatic and rely heavily on set-plays, as we saw in their 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday, but there is nothing wrong with that.Lots of other teams are the same and Spurs have got some big players to aim at, and others who can provide a good delivery.At the moment it does feel like they are looking for individual brilliance from their forward players in open play to provide the magic moments in games, rather than a system to play through the opposition.I look at them and think Kudus needs some help in that respect, but that help is coming.The biggest reason I think they will improve, however, is Frank himself.",
        "I don't believe Tottenham's​ current identity is set in stone because we saw how Brentford evolved under him over a number of seasons and he is only just getting started here.When they first came into the Premier League, Brentford had a very direct style and were also quite obvious or predictable in what they did.If you watched them last season, though, it was a totally different approach. They played out from the back through Christian Norgaard and although they could mix it up, they were not a one-trick pony.This Tottenham team is going to evolve too, but first and foremost Frank has given them a solid base like he had early on at Brentford. For example, with the way their full-backs stay at home a little bit more, rather than flying up the pitch like they did under Ange Postecoglou.We saw that on Sunday, where again Spurs got a bit of criticism for sitting back and inviting Everton on to them in the second half.There were times when I was thinking to myself, 'come on, get out of your half because you are putting yourself under pressure', but you have to consider what had gone before that game.Spurs had gone away from home in the Champions League on Wednesday and hung on for dear life for a draw against Monaco.",
        "Most of the team from that game started on Sunday too, and they were 2-0 up at half-time after a decent performance, where they limited Everton to a few chances.So, when you consider the travel and the intensity of that game against Monaco, I get why Frank decided to try to protect their lead after the break.I am sure that, looking back, he would have wanted them to have a bit more quality on the ball when they did break away, because they gave the ball up a bit too easily and put themselves under unnecessary pressure.In the weeks to come, against maybe higher quality opposition, then if they give away as much possession and sit off as deep as they did, they might get punished.Hopefully they will have more in their legs for those bigger tests and also some of those attacking players they have been missing are back too.",
        "Eventually, Frank will have to find the balance between being a front-footed attacking side that the fans enjoy watching and one that wins games because they are difficult to play against.That's something Tottenham have always struggled to find, which is the reason they have had so many changes of manager - Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte were one extreme, and Postecoglou was the other.But going from what we saw at Brentford, I think Frank will give the fans the type of football they want as well as delivering results.He's got a much better squad at Spurs than he ever had with Brentford, so it's naive to think this team won't progress and become easier on the eye - I believe they will, 100%.Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

This is the spot from which Shane Hendra and his friends have set off for away matches for years.\"This is exactly why we love football - for the adventure,\" he says.\"Since we came up, loads of teams have been complaining about having to come down here because of how far away it is, but we happily do it every other week.\"",

It's an extra special year.\"",
        "Fans of Truro are more used to spending away days supping pints in more placid provincial southern towns, but promotion has given them the opportunity to enjoy a fun-loving Friday night in one of the country's best party spots.Newcastle ticks every box.

        "Pre-match there are plenty of sore heads, which most opt to medicate with a free pint being offered by the Fog on the Tyne pub to the first 100 Truro fans who show up.Gateshead have the lowest average attendance in the National League, but play in a 11,800-capacity stadium designed to also host athletics events and gigs.The home stands are almost entirely empty, the temperature has dropped, and teeth are chattering on the away terrace as Truro kick off.The away attendance is 185, higher than usual, partly swelled by those enticed by the novelty of the journey and the presence of a few neutral groundhoppers wanting to be part of history.Truro are uncharacteristically electric when the match begins. They deservedly lead after five minutes through Dominic Johnson-Fisher. After two more goals are disallowed, they double their lead just before half-time through defender Christian Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose father Mark and brother Alex played for England during their careers.At half-time the away end is bedlam.But after the break Gateshead improve and score twice to equalise, the second goal coming in the 70th minute through striker Frank Nouble, who played in the Premier League for West Ham at the start of his senior career.Truro have a golden chance to win it in stoppage time, one-on-one with the keeper to beat, but Luke Jephcott puts his finish wide.\"I'd have taken a point before kick-off, I suppose,\" says Sharon Hinds, a decades-long fan who also played for the club's women's team.\"I'd be lost without coming to matches. We've been tiny for so long but feel like giants now. \"We're a proper family that takes care of each when things are hard. It's beautiful, really.\"",
        "Among the first fans to make it back to Truro are John and Tom Joyce.\"Has the trip been worth it? Absolutely,\" says John. \"This is a brotherhood, following our team is what we do, and this trip will live with us for a long time.\"Truro's new record is very unlikely to be beaten any time soon.Mousehole and Falmouth are both a little further south than Truro, but their respective teams play regionally a few tiers below, and only Premier League side Newcastle and eighth-tier Blyth Spartans are further north than Gateshead, making a league meeting with Truro improbable.This trip and those who made it, then, will hold a special place in football folklore.",

      "content": [
        "Bournemouth appear to have done it again.The Cherries have made a happy habit of unearthing hidden gems in recent seasons, helping the likes of Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi and Antoine Semenyo blossom from highly promising youngsters into established top-flight stars.Some of those players have gone on to make big-money moves elsewhere, with the Cherries pocketing £144.5m from the sales of Kerkez, Huijsen and Zabarnyi to Liverpool, Real Madrid and Paris St-Germain respectively.Whether Eli Junior Kroupi ends up following in the footsteps of the aforementioned trio remains to be seen, but the young striker certainly appears to be on the right track.The 19-year-old Frenchman followed up recent goals against Leeds and Crystal Palace with a thunderous strike in Bournemouth's 2-0 victory over Nottingham Forest on Sunday, which lifted the Cherries up to second in the table.The 30-yard piledriver was Kroupi's fourth of the season so far - across Europe's top five divisions, Eintracht Frankfurt's Can Uzun is the only teenager to net more league goals.\"He's an accomplished finisher already,\" Danny Murphy told BBC Sport after Sunday's win. \"He has just come in and it seems like he already knows what his role is in the team.\"He is good without the ball, good on the press and works hard - but when Bournemouth attack, he gets himself in good areas.\"Bournemouth have got a lot of players who, even with the ones they have sold, are becoming real stars in the Premier League. Their recruitment is just phenomenal.\"",
        "Signed in February to provide cover for first-choice frontman Evanilson, Kroupi is no stranger to breaking records.The Lorient academy graduate became the youngest-ever player to appear for the club's first team when he made his debut on the final day of the 2022-23 season, aged just 16 years and 345 days.His first goal for the Brittany outfit - in a 5-3 defeat at Nantes in September 2023 - made him the youngest scorer in the club's history, breaking the previous record set by former Swansea City, West Ham United and Forest forward Andre Ayew.And little over two weeks after that, Kroupi became the youngest player to score twice in a Ligue 1 game since 1974 in his team's 3-3 draw at Lyon.The son of former Ivorian footballer Eli Kroupi, who won the Coupe de France with Lorient in 2002, the teenager played a key role in firing the club back into Ligue 1 at the first attempt last term, ending his final season in France on 23 goals in all competitions.A calf injury to Evanilson, coupled with Enes Unal's long-term absence with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), has presented Kroupi with an early opportunity to impress his new employers - one he has grasped with both hands.\"Junior is a finisher,\" Andoni Iraola told BBC Match of the Day. \"His strength is that he smells the opportunities. His finishing is very good with his right foot and left foot.\"He has to add more to his game. He's coming to the Premier league and we still want more things.\"But if he helps us with goals like this it's always very welcome.\"",
        "Bournemouth fans could be forgiven for taking one or two souvenir screenshots of the Premier League table after Sunday's comfortable victory.The Cherries' tally of 18 points after nine games is their most at this stage of a top-flight season, surpassing the 17 they picked up under Eddie Howe in 2018-19.Their eight-game unbeaten run is the longest in the Premier League, while only Newcastle and Arsenal have kept more clean sheets than Iraola's side, who registered their fourth shut-out of the campaign against Forest.\"They are just a delight to watch because they are so energetic,\" Murphy said. \"They defend in numbers in games when they have to, but they don't park the bus - generally their attitude is to go and win games.\"They have been a breath of fresh air and there is nothing at the moment to suggest they are going to fall away. They are up there on merit at the moment.\"Those who have watched Iraola's post-match interviews on a regular basis, however, will not have been surprised to hear the 43-year-old play down his team's remarkable start.\"It's just a start,\" he said. \"This season, the differences between teams are so small. We now have [Manchester] City away and [Aston] Villa away before the [international] break, so it's going to be difficult to earn more points.\"Owner Bill Foley was in attendance at Vitality Stadium on Sunday, reportedly before talks with Iraola about extending the Spaniard's contract, which is due to expire at the end of the current season.But Iraola, unsurprisingly, is refusing to look too far ahead.\"[The owner and I] talk a lot,\" he said. \"Even when he's not here, we're in contact.\"We have a really good relationship. There's going to be time to talk, but this is just the start of the season.\"",

      "content": [
        "\"Whenever I walk in here, I can't help but recall how he used to move and the way he controlled the ball. It was something else.\"One of Mohamed Salah's first coaches is opening the all-new dark green gates of the youth centre in Nagrig, a village about three hours north of Cairo. This is where it all began for one of the world's most prolific forwards - a player who propelled Liverpool to the Premier League title in May.It was on the streets of Nagrig where a seven-year-old Salah, external would play football with his friends, pretending to be Brazil striker Ronaldo, France's legendary playmaker Zinedine Zidane or Italian maestro Francesco Totti.\"Mohamed was small compared to his team-mates, but he was doing things even the older boys couldn't manage,\" Ghamry Abd El-Hamid El-Saadany says as he points to the artificial pitch which is now named in Salah's honour.\"His shots were incredibly powerful, and it was obvious that he had determination and drive.\"Salah, 33, is about to embark on his ninth season at Liverpool, where the winger has scored a remarkable 245 goals in 402 league and cup appearances since joining in 2017.Egypt's first global football superstar has won every domestic honour as well as the Champions League with the Reds, but has yet to taste success with his country.With the Africa Cup of Nations in December and the 2026 World Cup on the horizon, BBC Sport visited Egypt to discover what Salah means to the people of the football-mad country of 115 million, and how a small boy from humble beginnings became a national icon.\"I still feel my father's joy when I watch Salah,\" says Lamisse El-Sadek, at the Dentists Cafe in the east of Cairo. \"After Salah joined Liverpool, we used to watch every match on television together.\"The cafe is named after the former owner's original profession and is now where Liverpool fans gather to watch matches on the big screen.Lamisse is wearing a Liverpool shirt with her father's name on the back. \"He sadly passed away two years ago,\" she adds.\"Every Liverpool game was some of the happiest two hours in our household every week and even if I had to miss some of the game due to school or work, my father used to text me minute-by-minute updates.\"Salah didn't come from a class of privilege. He really worked hard and sacrificed a lot to reach where he is now. A lot of us see ourselves in him.\"You can listen to the full version of Mohamed Salah: The Egyptian King here.",
        "The small farming village of Nagrig in the Egyptian Nile Delta is nestled in swathes of green fields, growing jasmine and watermelons. Water buffalos, cows and donkeys share dirt roads with cars, motorbikes and horse-drawn carts.It is here where one of the world's best and most prolific forwards, affectionately known as the 'Egyptian King', spent his early years.\"Salah's family is the foundation and secret behind his success,\" adds El-Saadany, who calls himself Salah's first coach after nurturing him when he was eight years old.\"They still live here with humility, values and respect. That's one reason people love them so much.\"The youth centre has been given an impressive upgrade recently in tribute to the village's most famous son, and the green playing surface would not look out of place at a professional training ground.\"They [Salah's family] made many sacrifices when he was young,\" says El-Saadany, who is standing next to a huge photograph that hangs behind one of the goals, showing Salah with the Champions League trophy.\"They were incredibly supportive from the very beginning, especially his father and his uncle, who is actually chairman of this centre.\"Salah's footprint is everywhere in Nagrig, where children run around wearing Liverpool and Egypt shirts with the player's name and number on the back.There is a mural of Salah outside his old school, while a tuk-tuk rushes past beeping its horn with a large sticker of the player smiling on the front.In the heart of Nagrig is the barber's shop where a teenage Salah would get his hair cut after training.\"I'm the one who gave him that curly hairstyle and the beard,\" says Ahmed El Masri.\"His friends told him not to get his hair cut here because we're from a village not a city, but he'd always come to me. The next day his friends would be surprised [at how good he looked] and ask him 'who's your barber?'.\"",
        "The hairdresser recalls watching Salah's skills at the youth centre and on the streets of the village.\"The big thing I remember most is that when we all played PlayStation, Salah would always choose to be Liverpool,\" he adds. \"The other boys would choose Manchester United or Barcelona, but he'd always be Liverpool.\"All the young kids now living in the village want to be like him.\"Salah's football education included a six-year spell at Cairo-based club Arab Contractors, also known as Al Mokawloon.He joined them at the age of 14 and the story of Salah being given permission to leave school early to make daily round trips, taking many hours, to train and play for Arab Contractors has become legendary in Egypt and beyond.",
        "A couple of the passengers on board the cramped, seven-seater Suzuki van on the edge of Nagrig are getting jittery.\"Are they getting on or not?\"This is not a bus service which runs to a timetable. In fact, the driver only leaves when it fills up.As a teenager this bus stop was where Salah started his long journey to training at  Arab Contractors. \"It was a tough journey and also incredibly expensive,\" El-Saadany says.\"He depended on himself and travelled alone most of the time. Imagine a child leaving at 10am and not returning until midnight. That journey required someone strong; only someone with a clear goal could bear such a burden.\"When we do jump on the bus, we are squeezed at the back behind a mother and her two sons and we head in the direction of a city called Basyoun, the first stop on Salah's regular journey to Cairo.He would then jump on another bus to Tanta, before changing again to get to the Ramses bus station in Cairo where there would be another switch before finally reaching his destination.After the early evening sessions it was time for the same long trip back to Nagrig and the same regular changes in reverse.The white microbuses darting around the roads at all hours are one of the first things you notice when you arrive in Cairo, packed with travellers hopping on and hopping off.\"These vehicles handle around 80% of commuters in a city home to over 10 million people,\" Egyptian journalist Wael El-Sayed explains.\"There are thousands of these vans working 24/7.\"",
        "Just the small journey to Basyoun is tough in hot and uncomfortable conditions at the back of the bus, so you can only imagine how challenging the much longer journey, several times a week, would have been for a teenage Salah.The coach who gave Salah his first international cap believes such experiences have helped provide the player with the mentality to succeed at the top level.\"To start as a football player here in Egypt is very hard,\" says Hany Ramzy.Ramzy was part of the Egypt side that faced England, external at the 1990 World Cup and spent 11 years playing in the Bundesliga. He handed Salah his senior Egypt debut in October 2011 when he was interim manager of the national side.He was also in charge of the Egypt Under-23 team that Salah played in at the London 2012 Olympics.\"I also had to take buses and walk five or six kilometres to get to my first club of Al Ahly and my father couldn't afford football boots for me,\" adds Ramzy.\"Salah playing at the top level and staying at the top level for so many years was 100% shaped by this because this kind of life builds strong players.\"",
        "Driving into Cairo over one of its busiest bridges, a huge electronic billboard flicks from an ice cream advert to a picture of Salah next to the Arabic word 'shukran', which means 'thank you'.Waiting at a nearby office is Diaa El-Sayed, one of the most influential coaches in Salah's early career.He was the coach when Salah made his first impact on the global stage, at the 2011 Under-20 World Cup in Colombia.\"The country wasn't stable, there was a revolution, so preparing for the tournament was tough for us,\" says the man everyone calls 'Captain Diaa'.\"Salah came with us and the first thing that stood out was his speed and that he was always concentrating. He's gone far because he listens so well, no arguments with anyone, always listening and working, listening and working. He deserves what he has.\"'Captain Diaa' recalls telling a young Salah to stay away from his own penalty area and just concentrate on attacking.\"Then against Argentina, external he came back to defend in the 18-yard box and gave away a penalty,\" he says, laughing.\"I told him, 'don't defend, why are you in our box? You can't defend!'.\"After Liverpool won the Premier League title last season, I heard him saying Arne Slot tells him not to defend. But I was the first coach who told him not to defend.\"",
        "Salah has played for the senior national team for 14 years and his importance to Egypt is such that high-ranking government officials have been known to get involved when he has been injured.\"I even had calls from Egypt's Minister of Health,\" recalls Dr Mohamed Aboud, the national team's medic, about the time Salah suffered a serious shoulder injury in Liverpool's defeat to Real Madrid in the 2018 Champions League final, leading to speculation he could miss the World Cup in Russia a few weeks later.\"I told him not to panic, everything is going well.\"Speaking from his medical clinic in the Maadi area of Egypt's capital, Dr Aboud adds: \"I was younger and the pressure from inside the country was intense.\"I had calls from so many people trying to help. One of our board members told me I was now one of the most important people in the whole world.\"This situation changed me as a person.\"For the record, Salah did recover to play in two of his country's three group games but was unable to prevent Egypt from making a quick exit after defeats to Uruguay, Russia and Saudi Arabia.\"I need to tell you that Salah was involved in every single goal in our 2018 World Cup qualification campaign,\" says former Egypt assistant coach Mahmoud Fayez at his home on the outskirts of Cairo.Salah had scored a dramatic 95th-minute penalty against Congo in Alexandria to secure a 2-1 win and book Egypt's place at the World Cup, with one qualifying game to spare, for the first time in 28 years.In a nail-biting game, Salah put Egypt ahead before Congo equalised three minutes from time.\"Do you know when you can listen to silence? I listened to the silence when Congo scored - 75,000 fans and silence everywhere,\" adds Fayez.Then came the penalty that turned Salah into a national hero.\"Imagine it, a nation of nearly 120 million waiting for this moment to qualify,\" says Fayez. \"He had the toughest and most difficult moment for one player, a penalty in the 95th minute that Mohamed had to score.\"He scored it and he made us all proud. In the dressing room afterwards he started to dance, hug everyone and he was shouting 'we did it, we did it', after 28 years, we did it.\"In Cairo is a football academy called 'The Maker', founded and run by former Tottenham and Egypt striker Mido, who is hoping to produce players who will follow in Salah's footsteps.\"I played for the national team in front of 110,000 people when I was only 17, the youngest player to represent Egypt,\" Mido says. \"I love to feel that people depend on me and Salah is the same.\"At the time of our visit, a classroom lesson for young players about the mindset required to become a top professional is taking place.Underneath Salah's name on a whiteboard, one of the coaches has written \"discipline, dedication and motivation\".\"The reason Salah is where he is now is because he works on his mental strength daily,\" Mido adds.\"He is the greatest ambassador for Egypt and for African players as well. He made European clubs respect Arab players, this is what Salah has done.\"I think a lot of European clubs now, when they see a young player from Egypt, they think of Salah. He has made our young players dream.\"",
        "Back to Nagrig and we meet Rashida, a 70-year-old who sells vegetables from a small stall. She talks about how Salah has changed her life and the lives of hundreds of other people in the village where he was born and raised.\"Mohamed is a good man. He's respectful and kind, he's like a brother to us,\" Rashida says.She is one of many people in the village who have benefited from the work of Salah's charity, which gives back to the place where his journey to football stardom started.\"The aim is to help orphans, divorced and widowed women, the poor, and the sick,\" says Hassan Bakr from the Mohamed Salah Charity Foundation.\"It provides monthly support, meals and food boxes on holidays and special occasions. For example [with Rashida] there's a supplement to the pension a widow receives.\"When Mohamed is here he stays humble, walking around in normal clothes, never showing off. People love him because of his modesty and kindness.\"As well as the charity helping people like Rashida, Salah has funded a new post office to serve the local community, an ambulance unit, a religious institute and has donated land for a sewage station, among other projects.When Liverpool won the English league title for a record-equalling 20th time last season, fans turned up at a local cafe in Nagrig to watch on television and celebrate the village's famous son.With there be more celebrations in Salah's home village in 2025-26?Despite helping Liverpool to the Premier League title in 2019-20 and 2024-25, the player has yet to lift a trophy for his country.The generation before Salah won three Africa Cup of Nations titles in a row between 2006 and 2010. Since then, there have been two defeats in finals, against Cameroon in 2017 and Senegal in the 2021 edition, which took place in early 2022.With the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations starting on 21 December - six months before the World Cup - do Egyptians feel that the 33-year-old now needs to deliver on the international stage?\"Salah has already done his legacy. He's the greatest Egyptian footballer in our history,\" says Mido.\"He doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, he's a legend for Liverpool and a legend for Egypt.\"",

        "A popular chant among match-going Tottenham fans at the moment is: \"I don't care about Levy, he doesn't care about me, all I care about is Kulusevski.\"Prominent banners at the home defeat by Leicester last month read: \"Our game is about glory, Levy's game is about greed\" and \"24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - time for change\".A crisis of about 30 separate injuries and poor form has left manager Ange Postecoglou exposed, irritable, and under pressure, with his side 14th in the Premier League and out of both domestic cups.The debate about who or what is to blame for Spurs' struggles is going round in circles. Alongside Manchester United's failings and Manchester City's decline, it has been one of the narratives of this season.Fan anger has again been aimed at chairman Daniel Levy - vocalised in persistent 'Levy out' calls from supporters both home and away.Club sources told BBC Sport the protests are \"hurting\" Levy, who attends almost every game and sits stoically through the criticism.Tottenham were one of the busiest clubs in the January transfer window, but that has not satisfied some fans who criticise a recruitment policy mainly focused on under-21 players with potential resale value, and who regularly accuse Levy of acting too slowly in the market and putting profits above success on the pitch.A 'sit-down' protest - led by a smaller supporter group called Change for Tottenham (CFT) - is planned against Levy before Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester United.Last week, the main fan group - the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust (THST) - released five core principles they want to hold Levy to account on.Among those principles were demands to \"commit to winning\" with investment; \"attract and retain talent\" with competitive wages; \"develop elite youth talent\"; \"lead with integrity\" to be \"financially sustainable\" while \"keeping tickets affordable\"; and engage with fans.BBC Sport has spoken to several people on and off the record to try to understand the fuller picture of Levy's Tottenham regime.Some of the key points made were:Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Spurs and \"every option is open\" for different future ownership structuresHe is \"hurt\" by protests, \"hurt\" by results, and has opted to sit through the 'Levy out' chants rather than hide awayAn acceptance Spurs have not always spent well in the transfer market but belief that recent managers, including Postecoglou, have been backed financiallyClub leadership feel they have come closer to winning more than just the 2008 League Cup in the Enic/Levy era having reached 15 semi-finals and six finalsSources who have worked with Levy say he does not communicate well enough and suggest the executive team are too similar, hence occasional \"own goals\" on policies.",
        "Football finance expert Kieran Maguire says any discussion of Levy's tenure must be framed by Tottenham becoming the \"most profitable club in Premier League history\" because of the money their new stadium generates, a historically lower wage structure and a \"degree of caution\" on transfer spending.He describes Spurs as a \"superb cash-making machine\" who have \"outperformed any other club in England\".Maguire outlined:His figures show that from 2001 to 2023, Tottenham made £171m profit. Burnley were second on £159m, with Arsenal third on £105mIn the past decade, Spurs have the sixth-highest total wage bill in the Premier League (£1.6bn vs Man City's £2.9bn as the highest); the sixth-highest transfer spend (£1.3bn vs Chelsea's £2.8bn as the most); with the fifth-highest net spend over a similar periodTottenham fans pay among the highest season ticket prices and matchday prices in the top flightLevy has the highest chief executive pay of Premier League clubs that declare such data. In 2023, the most recent figures available, Spurs' highest-paid director - unnamed but assumed to be Levy - earned £6.6m.",
        "Club insiders describe Levy, 63, as \"shy, quiet and hard-working\" - and a man who loves the club and is affected by fan criticism. Multiple sources who know him have expressed respect for Tottenham's progress under his leadership.One source with knowledge of the inner workings of the club, who wished to remain anonymous, said Levy can be \"very ruthless\" but \"genuinely wants the best for Spurs\".They claimed some of the \"own goals\" - such as using the government furlough scheme during Covid in 2020 and more recently phasing out senior concession tickets - are partly because Levy does not \"surround himself with the best people\". They described the executive leadership and club board, which includes operations and finance director Matthew Collecott and executive director Donna-Maria Cullen, as \"people too similar to him\" who will \"sit with their heads in their phones\", rather than \"people who make up for [Levy's] weaknesses\".The source said Levy does not successfully deliver his messages about caring for the club because he is not a strong public speaker and chooses to avoid it, adding: \"One interview or being visible once a year is not a lot.\"While Tottenham's football structure has changed frequently, including technical directors, managing directors and heads of football operations, sources say the club rigidly sticks to  \"Levy's philosophy and recruitment policy - to buy young players with promise who can add value\".Another source who has worked with Levy in the Spurs hierarchy, also speaking anonymously, backed his passion for the club and said the idea the chairman does not care because he rarely shows emotion is \"nonsense\".They added that Levy is unrelenting - working \"crazy\" hours which can be tough and tiring for colleagues - and always wants more, something which can grate with people who do not like that style of leadership.",
        "Sources at the club believe Levy will step aside when he feels it is right for Tottenham. They say he would not be motivated by vanity to stay on if there was an outright takeover - and the club remains open to investment with all future ownership structures on the table.While Levy may be the focal point of protests, it was stressed that he is a minority shareholder of the club through his own family trust - and Enic, itself mostly owned by the Lewis family trust, remains the majority owner.That means any change or purchase would need approval from the Lewis family, and there are other minority shareholders with a say.During the current protests, the THST has expressed frustration but has not called for Levy to leave, unlike CFT, which is a smaller splinter group looking to apply pressure in internal fan politics and towards the club.Other sources agreed the only realistic way in which Levy would leave Spurs would be on his own terms. He is the Premier League's highest-paid chief executive - earning an estimated £50m-plus over his 25 years in charge.This week a Guardian article reported potential interest in Tottenham from an unnamed Qatari consortium, although sources with knowledge of Spurs' ownership situation played it down.In 2023, when Paris St-Germain's owners Qatari Sports Investment (QSI) were exploring the possibility of a minority stake in an English club, Tottenham were one of the teams linked. Levy maintains a close relationship with PSG and QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi.One source added that Levy - a renowned negotiator famously described by Sir Alex Ferguson as \"more painful [to deal with] than a hip replacement\" - will demand a high price for Spurs given their elite facilities, brand, London premium and the revenue the club now generates.",
        "Various reports in recent years have valued Tottenham at between £3.5bn and £4bn.Chelsea were bought in a deal worth up to £4.25bn from Roman Abramovich in 2022 by a consortium led by American investor Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital. The purchase price was £2.5bn with a commitment to spending £1.75bn over the next 10 years.Meanwhile, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos bought a 25% stake in Manchester United for £1.03bn in December 2023 in a process which included a rival bid from Qatar's Sheikh Jassim, reported to be nearer to £5bn for 100% of the club.Despite those huge sums, both clubs - unlike Tottenham - need major investment in their stadiums to unlock bigger commercial earning potential.According to the first source, the period when Tottenham were building their new £1.2bn stadium, between 2017 and 2019, meant Levy was \"all-consumed\" and the board \"left everyone to do their jobs\". Spurs secured Champions League football under Mauricio Pochettino for four successive seasons to 2018-19 - and were beaten in the 2019 final by Liverpool.That source suggested Levy's approach - namely \"open to conversations but set in his ways\" - has meant a lot of people with off-field expertise have left Spurs over the years for more influential jobs.Paul Barber was an executive director between 2005-2010 and is now Brighton chief executive; Michael Edwards was Spurs' chief analyst from 2009-2011 before leaving for Liverpool; FA technical director John McDermott was Tottenham's head of academy and player development until 2020; while EFL chief executive Trevor Birch was - very briefly - Tottenham's director of football operations, from September 2020 to January 2021.It could be argued that many of these highly-rated executives enjoyed good careers at Tottenham before simply moving on - but the source claims they \"left the building far too easily\".Another source to have worked closely with Levy at Spurs, again speaking anonymously, pointed out he has delivered \"a core infrastructure that is probably the best in the world\" and suggested that would give the club \"an incredible foundation for future success - probably after Daniel's time\".They said it had taken Arsenal 10 to 15 years to get back to competing for titles and regularly qualifying for Champions League football after they rebuilt their infrastructure, with Levy having inherited a dilapidated stadium, old training ground and ageing squad.However, the source suggested Levy has not yet got the \"formula right\" by employing the right head coach with the right players at the same time.",
        "One criticism some fans have consistently aimed at Levy and Tottenham's executive board is a lack of understanding of what it takes to succeed on the pitch.Levy, Collecott and Cullen have worked together for a quarter of a century - one source described them as \"the Holy Trinity to an extent\" - with the chairman known to be \"loyal to people loyal to him\".They are supported at the top level by director of football administration and governance Rebecca Caplehorn and non-executive director Jonathan Turner.The source said that in their experience at Tottenham there was no block on outside or different views, but it can be hard for newcomers especially those without an affinity to Spurs.They added that Levy, Collecott, 56, and Cullen, 61 are \"probably an unbreakable group\" given their longevity and close relationships, but did stress they will not be at Tottenham forever.It was suggested to BBC Sport that personal factors such as age and the trio's own health or the health of relatives could lead them to \"re-evaluate\".Sources inside the club accepted the various backgrounds of people on Tottenham's board mean they know more about business than football, but pointed out that another six-person board - which includes chief football officer Scott Munn and technical director Johan Lange - sits underneath to advise on all football decisions. They will have a major say on any managerial appointments, while transfers are led by Lange and only finalised by Levy - with Munn running the rest of the football operation.Tottenham insiders accept they have not always spent well, and have made transfer mistakes in the past, but believe they have backed recent managers - including Postecoglou - and are happy with deals such as those for Dominic Solanke, Archie Gray and Lucas Bergvall.",
        "It is also felt that raising profits to record levels is the only way Tottenham can compete with teams like Man City and Newcastle and their ownership models.Spurs sources feel they have been close to winning more trophies than just one trophy in the Enic/Levy era - having reached 15 semi-finals and six finals - and the five other clubs in the 'traditional top six' are either richer or bigger.\"We don't make any apologies that we are trying to increase our revenue base to invest more in our teams if that means raising money through concerts to invest in the teams then I don't apologise at all,\" Levy said at September's fan forum.\"We announced with our last results that we believe this club needs a bigger capital base because we've got a lot of exciting projects on the horizon and we want to make further investment in the teams. Some form of minority investment is what we're looking for.\"In a further defence of Levy, one source pointed to fan discontent at Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke in 2019 and 2021, as well as Manchester United's 12 months of troubles under new co-owner Ratcliffe. They believe a \"vocal minority\" of fans simply want success now, but should be careful what they wish for with calls for change.They added: \"Spurs haven't got the formula on the pitch just yet but it will come.\"",

      "topic": "When River Plate icon Diaz took over fourth-tier Oxford",
      "content": [
        "Twenty years ago a Copa Libertadores-winning legend turned up to manage mid-table fourth tier side Oxford United.Six months later Ramon Diaz and the rest of his seven-man entourage were blocked from even entering the ground.It seems unlikely anybody will ever join the former River Plate manager, who played for Argentina, Inter Milan, Monaco and others, in winning South America's top tournament - and the League Two manager of the month award.BBC Sport tell the story with help from former players Steve Basham, Chris Tardif and Lucas Cominelli, BBC Oxford editor Jerome Sale, and Jean Marc Goiran, the man who brokered the deal and acted as assistant manager, translator and unofficial chief executive.",
        "It was December 2004. Oxford United, the 1986 League Cup winners, were in a slump, having dropped from the second tier to the fourth since 1999 - and were sliding down League Two when owner Firoz Kassam sacked Graham Rix.Kassam, the club's unpopular owner, invited out-of-work manager Chris Turner to watch their 1-0 defeat by Swansea - and most people thought he was the new manager, including the Oxford Mail, external and some players.But instead... \"It was quite bizarre,\" said former U's striker Basham. \"Five or six guys came in, in a line. They all stood in front of us and none of them spoke a word of English, apart from one translator.\"Goiran said \"all the players had wide-open eyes wondering 'who are these guys?'\".Those guys were Diaz, head coach Horacio Rodriguez, another coach Raul Marcovich, Goiran, fitness trainer Pablo Fernandez, doctor Rafael Giulietti and translator Giuilliano Iacoppi.But wait, how did it come to this? It all starts in Monaco - where Kassam and Goiran lived and Diaz also had a home having played for the club.Kassam approached a friend of a friend, Goiran, who has worked as a football agent and consultant, to help him find a manager and the Monegasque suggested Diaz - who had left River Plate in 2002.At the time it was widely reported that Diaz was not being paid to be Oxford manager - and Kassam said he had \"promised him shares in the club in return for success\".But Goiran, speaking 20 years on, says Kassam's company Firoka, but not the club, instead paid Diaz and Goiran consulting fees in Monaco.And the question many have asked - why did a manager with five Argentine titles and the Copa Libertadores come to League Two Oxford? Goiran says it was part of a project to get to the Premier League in five years - but after a bitter ending, Diaz, who is now Corinthians manager in Brazil, never worked in England or even Europe again.\"When they first came in, there were grand talks about redeveloping the stadium, putting a new stand behind the goal and taking us into the Premier League,\" said goalkeeper Tardif.",
        "Back in 2004 there was less foreign involvement in the lower leagues in England, so it was an even big culture shock then than it is now.But many of the players bought into the new training ideas, although some struggled to adapt.\"They brought something very new and very fresh to Oxford United at that time,\" said Basham, who played for the club between 2002 and 2007.\"It was way before its time. They came in with ideas and the philosophy that probably hit the English game two, three, four years later, certainly in the lower leagues.\"Rodriguez would be hands-on - with Diaz overseeing things. To some around the club Rodriguez was seen as the traditional boss of the team with Diaz almost a director of football.Diaz and his coaches only spoke broken English, so had to communicate via their translator.But Goiran, who was involved on the training pitch too, says Diaz was the manager and had the final say in everything. Basham said: \"He [Diaz] would come in amongst the team as we were laid out in our shape and he would take us through with movements. Very different, but it worked. \"He'd physically move you, he would then have you alongside him and he'd make the runs and you would make those runs with him.\"Goiran said: \"It was a very nice atmosphere. It was a great adventure. We changed the way they trained, the mentality. We taught them they are football players.\"They were popular figures off the pitch too.BBC Oxford's Sale said: \"Ramon and his staff were imposing and impressive, but also gentle and friendly. \"He once asked me for $100,000 for interviews. I said the BBC wouldn't stretch that far. He said just to bring him a decent coffee next time then.\"",
        "It all started so well.

        "The new management team wanted to freshen up the squad and brought in a host of trialists - some days about half of the people training were trialists.Out of those came a few South American signings - midfielder Lucas Cominelli, winger Juan Pablo Raponi and Uruguayan defender Mateo Corbo. Diaz's sons Emiliano and Michael - who was young and never played for the first team - also joined.Results were mixed.Cominelli played 16 times, scoring a long-range effort against Grimsby, and was seen as one of the successes.\"Oxford were fantastic,\" said Cominelli, who had once been on the books of Newcastle without making a first-team appearance.\"It was really good. I had a good experience, a good memory of it from the fans, the city, the club.\"Full-back Corbo remains a cult hero at the club after eight yellow cards and a red card in 13 games.Raponi, who had played for River Plate, was too lightweight for League Two but played 10 times.Emiliano Diaz, who played seven times, is often mentioned in discussions about Oxford's worst ever players.That was just one of many times he worked with his dad - having played under Ramon at River Plate and been his assistant manager at over 10 teams since retiring.Cominelli added there were never issues between the England and South American players.\"The team-mates were really OK,\" he said. \"It was really welcome. They helped and everything. We had a good dressing room.\"Basham added: \"Some [were] good, some not so good. Some fitted in really well. A couple were superb, really worked hard, good on the ball, really good additions to the side. \"And then you had one or two that it didn't quite work out for them.\"Raponi was very quick, he made an impact at times, but the physical side of the game sometimes was a bit too much for him.\"",
        "After the good run in January, though, Oxford's form took a dip, losing four of the next five games.And things were unravelling off the pitch too.Diaz and Kassam fell out over a difference of opinion in the ambition of the club - and over Diaz not speaking English.The manager, plus some of his coaches, missed a few games for work permit or passport reasons.Basham said it just \"fizzled out\" as the club finished 15th - nowhere near the top or bottom.\"It's almost surreal looking back,\" said Tardif. \"It was difficult for them coming in our level. They weren't quite ready for having to do the basics over and over again. \"I really liked them as people. Do I think it was the right match? Probably not.\"Goiran was in discussions with Kassam about how to structure the club's marketing and finding investment. \"There were a lot of things to do because the club was not professional for me,\" he said. \"I spent about 12 hours per day minimum working on that and we made a lot of progress. \"I was more like a chief executive than other things - but I was still close on the training ground.\"The relationship between Ramon and Firoz was difficult. They discussed the future and financial things. Ramon didn't feel that Firoz would like to grow [the club].\"Basham said: \"I think they had really big plans for Oxford United. They were all pushing in the right direction.\"I think they all thought they were close to some sort of deal with Kassam and for whatever reason it all just ended up... yeah, there was a big fallout, which was a real shame.\"",
        "Once it was obvious Diaz would probably leave the club, Goiran tried to find another manager for the project.Diaz resigned as manager and he and his sons flew home before the penultimate game of the season. \"His decision to leave was unexpected and I am disappointed,\" said Kassam at the time - who added keeping Diaz would have cost the club £1m.The Oxford Mail even reported that Rodriguez was set to become the new manager., externalBut suddenly the entire experiment was over. Before the final game of the season, at home to Chester, Kassam got rid of Diaz's entire backroom staff and appointed Brian Talbot.Goiran was offered the chance to stay but said \"I brought these people in and if they're going out I have to go with them\". \"Everything was so OK except the relationship between Firoz and Ramon. We had a lot of good plans for the future, a lot of ideas regarding investors to change the club and grow. But it was a bad ending,\" Goiran said.And it got very messy as Diaz and his coaches bought tickets to watch the final game of the season against Chester and to say thank you to the Oxford supporters.But Kassam ordered his stewards to refuse them entry and an argument broke out 10 minutes into the game - with fans leaving their seats to ask they be let in.\"We had to take the car and left everything there. It was not a good ending,\" said Goiran.\"I was very sad to leave the club. It was a fantastic time. I did it with my heart plus everything. The feeling I have with the fans was 'wow'. \"It's my club forever - I’m always looking at their results. It's a love story between me and Oxford.\"That was the end of all the South American players too.Cominelli said: \"The club had offered me a new contract. I wanted to stay but the new coach who came [Talbot], he decided all the foreign players [should be] gone.\"Kassam and Diaz, through his current club Corinthians, did not respond to requests to speak to the BBC for this feature.The following season Talbot was sacked, Kassam sold the club and Oxford were relegated to the Conference.",

        "Six months later Ramon Diaz and the rest of his seven-man entourage were blocked from even entering the ground.",
        "It seems unlikely anybody will ever join the former River Plate manager, who played for Argentina, Inter Milan, Monaco and others, in winning South America's top tournament - and the League Two manager of the month award.",
        "BBC Sport tell the story with help from former players Steve Basham, Chris Tardif and Lucas Cominelli, BBC Oxford editor Jerome Sale, and Jean Marc Goiran, the man who brokered the deal and acted as assistant manager, translator and unofficial chief executive.",
        "Fitness coach Pablo Fernandez, translator Guilliano Iacoppi, boss Ramon Diaz, coach Horatio Rodriguez and assistant Jean Marc Goiran (pictured from left to right) were five of the seven-strong party",
        "It was December 2004.",
        "Oxford United, the 1986 League Cup winners, were in a slump, having dropped from the second tier to the fourth since 1999 - and were sliding down League Two when owner Firoz Kassam sacked Graham Rix.",
        "Kassam, the club's unpopular owner, invited out-of-work manager Chris Turner to watch their 1-0 defeat by Swansea - and most people thought he was the new manager, including the Oxford Mail, external and some players.",
        "But instead... \"It was quite bizarre,\" said former U's striker Basham. \"Five or six guys came in, in a line. They all stood in front of us and none of them spoke a word of English, apart from one translator.\"",
        "Goiran said \"all the players had wide-open eyes wondering 'who are these guys?'\".",

        "Kassam approached a friend of a friend, Goiran, who has worked as a football agent and consultant, to help him find a manager and the Monegasque suggested Diaz - who had left River Plate in 2002.",
        "At the time it was widely reported that Diaz was not being paid to be Oxford manager - and Kassam said he had \"promised him shares in the club in return for success\".",
        "But Goiran, speaking 20 years on, says Kassam's company Firoka, but not the club, instead paid Diaz and Goiran consulting fees in Monaco.",
        "And the question many have asked - why did a manager with five Argentine titles and the Copa Libertadores come to League Two Oxford?",
        "Goiran says it was part of a project to get to the Premier League in five years - but after a bitter ending, Diaz, who is now Corinthians manager in Brazil, never worked in England or even Europe again.",

        "Back in 2004 there was less foreign involvement in the lower leagues in England, so it was an even big culture shock then than it is now.",

        "\"It was way before its time. They came in with ideas and the philosophy that probably hit the English game two, three, four years later, certainly in the lower leagues.\"",
        "Rodriguez would be hands-on - with Diaz overseeing things. To some around the club Rodriguez was seen as the traditional boss of the team with Diaz almost a director of football.",
        "Diaz and his coaches only spoke broken English, so had to communicate via their translator.",
        "But Goiran, who was involved on the training pitch too, says Diaz was the manager and had the final say in everything.",
        "Basham said: \"He [Diaz] would come in amongst the team as we were laid out in our shape and he would take us through with movements. Very different, but it worked.",
        "\"He'd physically move you, he would then have you alongside him and he'd make the runs and you would make those runs with him.\"",
        "Goiran said: \"It was a very nice atmosphere. It was a great adventure. We changed the way they trained, the mentality. We taught them they are football players.\"",

        "Vinay Menon knew little about Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. He knew even less about football; he had never seen a match in his life.But as he approached the door of Abramovich's west London mansion in 2009, he was about to have a meeting that would change his life and transform him into, arguably, the most famous Indian in the sport.Born in Kerala and inspired by his maternal 'yogi' grandfather to pursue a career in wellness, Menon was a word-of-mouth recommendation to the Russian oligarch. He was delivering wellness, yoga and relaxation exercises to billionaires and celebrities at a luxury hotel in Dubai, when the father of Abramovich's then-wife Dasha booked in for a session.Menon then came to London to run private classes for the Abramovichs. But Roman was so impressed by Menon that he sent him to Chelsea's Cobham training ground with a brief to work with the first-team squad as the Premier League's first wellness coach.\"Roman asked for it to happen and it happened,\" Menon says.\"I was an Indian, who was never exposed to football, entering a massive club and it seemed impossible.\"There was a big barrier, but it was not an immovable rock because it came from the owner himself - he initiated that change so everyone was ready to try.\"",
        "Still, the arrival of Menon and his philosophy was a culture shock for a squad who had finished as either Premier League champions or runners-up in the previous five seasons. \"We are talking about elite performance - change is always difficult,\" Menon says.\"Adding or taking away is always difficult, people don't want to change because they are already performing and winning. Why should they?\"Everyone treated me well but training the players wasn't easy initially. I should thank a few players, who were ready to try me.\"None of the players were obliged to work with Menon. Instead his services were available if any felt they would be useful.Striker Didier Drogba quickly became Menon's key advocate.",
        "\"Didier was the initial one – Chelsea is like one big family and we just sat and ate in the canteen with the players and so we started a conversation organically while eating,\" says Menon.\"He asked what I can do for him, and I told him we can try this, and he asked me to try right away. That was the moment where football opened in front of me.\"After that Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, John Terry began coming to me to try it. \"The medical department were fantastic and made me part of their team, despite being from a different discipline.\"Menon's sessions involved meditation, sharpening players' mental approach and dispelling the negative thoughts that can come with top-flight pressure and scrutiny.\"I was a person without a title, teaching the players self-care and how to balance, spiritually, emotionally, and ultimately impact them physically,\" says Menon.\"They are human beings and need a friend to giggle with, babble to and then they will open up.\"You need to be happy in the mind in sports and business. It’s the same – the mind is everything.\"Menon was a constant presence in the Chelsea backroom staff for 13 years, working under managers such as Carlo Ancelotti, Rafael Benitez, Jose Mourinho, Antonio Conte and, finally, Thomas Tuchel.\"I got the chance to be part of all the trophies Chelsea won from 2010,\" he says. \"What an experience, it was an unbelievable space, I miss it a lot, frankly.”",
        "Menon was part of a huge cull of Chelsea staff, notably in the medical department, when Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital bought the club in 2022 from Abramovich.Abramovich was forced to sell after being sanctioned for links to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.The upheaval at the club has coincided with a run of injuries among Chelsea's squad but Menon backs the new owners to stabilise the club.\"Change is inevitable in life,\" he says. \"The old regime had a lot of success and put a big mark on the club. \"Another management team came in which is very ambitious, very different, from a different region, understanding football on a different level.\"They need time to adapt, they are maybe in a sort of pre-season, I believe they will adapt. I worked with the new management and they are good.\"I wish them all the best; I am still a Chelsea fan and the club gave me everything I have.\"",
        "Menon blazed a new trail in 2022, travelling to the World Cup as part of Roberto Martinez's Belgium staff. India – the most populous nation on earth – has never qualified for the tournament and Menon's presence caught the attention of his compatriots.\"This representation always helps my home country and the young generation to show that there is a career,\" he says.\"We can be in this arena. If you are not in as a player, at least in the backroom staff. Traditionally, in India most parents say you should first study and then play. I want to change that so study and play is 50/50. You need to follow your dreams.\"Menon believes infrastructure will need to change, along with mindset, if his home country is to become a factor on the international football scene.\"We are a country of 1.4bn people and the main problem is filtration,\" he adds.\"We need a minimum 100 grassroots level clubs to filter this. It is about structuring the grassroots level and schools.“If you systemise it, we will have a team.“At the last World Cup, many Indians were in Qatar and followed Messi and Ronaldo's journey. But we need a cultural change. Sports are important for the future, mental wellness, health, economy as well.\"I have had these conversations before in India and if my country needs me, I will always be there. I am sure sooner or later we will be at the World Cup.\"",

        "Four thousand miles away, another kit bag had been packed and its owner, one of Africa’s best footballers, was preparing to go for a long run.Kalusha Bwalya was Africa’s Player of the Year in 1988.Earlier that year, he had scored a hat-trick as Zambia thrashed Italy 4-0 on the way to the Olympic quarter-finals in Seoul.Since then, he had moved to PSV Eindhoven, partnering Brazilian great Romario up front for the reigning Dutch champions.Bwalya and two other Europe-based players were due to meet up with their Zambia team-mates in Senegal, before the first of four qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup.Zambia's stellar generation of players were strongly fancied to take their nation to the tournament for the first time.LISTEN: Amazing Sport Stories: Copper BulletsWith the prospect of a flight itinerary taking him from Amsterdam to Dakar via Paris, Bwalya wanted to stretch his legs and clear his mind.But, before he could leave on his run, his landline rang.In the early 1990s, mobile phones were a rare luxury. One Bwalya didn't have. Calls could not be ignored.Bwalya picked up the receiver.\"It was the treasurer of the Football Association of Zambia,\" says Bwalya.\"The first thing he said to me was, ‘Kalu, you have to delay your flight. There has been an accident.’”",
        "For Zambia's population, its football team was a beacon of hope.The price of copper, the country's primary export, had almost halved in the past four years, tanking the economy. Income had dropped sharply. President Frederick Chiluba had declared a national state of emergency, alleging that a coup plot against him had been uncovered.The football team though were a source of pride.They were known as Chipolo-polo, the Copper Bullets.It was a nickname derived from Zambia’s main industry and the team's attacking, aggressive style.The team had just returned from a 3-0 win over Mauritius in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.They had an eight-year unbeaten home record and were a band of brothers at the peak of their powers.As far as Zambians were concerned, USA ’94 was beckoning. To get there they would have to top a qualification pool of three, trumping Morocco and Senegal in home-and-away ties.First up, Senegal away.As usual it was a DHC-5 Buffalo military plane that would take them there.With the recession eating into its funding, the football association couldn’t afford commercial flights.Instead the DHC-5 Buffalo, an 18-year-old twin-propeller aircraft, early models of which had been used in the Vietnam War, would lumber across the vastness of Africa.It was not built for long-haul trips so it would have to make regular refuelling stops.And it was showing its age. Six months earlier, while flying over the Indian Ocean en route to play Madagascar, the pilot had actually told the players to wear their life jackets.When Zambia's domestic-based players turned up to the airfield outside the capital city Lusaka to board, Patrick Kangwa, a member of the national team selection committee, met them.He told 21-year-old midfielder Andrew Tembo and third-choice goalkeeper Martin Mumba that they wouldn't need to travel. They were dropped from the squad.Pride was hurt and hot words exchanged on the tarmac.It was a standard selection decision, but, on this day, it decided who would live and who would die.Those who did get onboard faced a daunting itinerary. The Buffalo planned to touch down and refuel in the Republic of Congo, Gabon and Ivory Coast before finally arriving in Dakar, Senegal's capital.In reality, it never made it beyond Gabon.The Zambian government has never released the report into what happened to the flight.But in 2003, the Gabonese authorities said that almost immediately after take-off from the capital Libreville, the plane’s left-hand engine stopped working.The pilot, tired from flying the team back from Mauritius the day before, shut down the right-hand engine by mistake.The heavy plane, suddenly without power or lift, plunged into the ocean a few hundred metres from the Gabon coast, killing all 30 people on board.Back in the Netherlands, Bwalya, his run forgotten, saw the news he already knew break on television.“There was a lady reading the news and the Zambian flag was behind her,\" he remembers.\"She said, ‘the Zambian national soccer team traveling to Dakar, Senegal, for a World Cup qualifier has crashed. There are no survivors’.“Ambition - as a young person, brothers, team-mates, the spirit of the group – was lost in one day. But it seems like yesterday, it’s so clear in my mind.”Kangwa – the official who had sent the selected players on their way in Lusaka – flew to Gabon.At a stroke, his role had changed from picking players to identifying their remains.“The bodies had been in the water for some time so some had started to change in state,” he says in BBC World Service podcast Copper Bullets.“I had to try and say, who’s this, who can this be?“After that, I cried, we all cried. None of us thought that we would find ourselves in a place where we would see our colleagues in pieces.”Meanwhile, Bwalya arrived in Lusaka, where reality sank in.\"We went to receive the bodies, and, one by one, they took the coffins off a plane to be transported to the Independence Stadium,\" he says.\"That was when I realised I won’t see the team – the one I had travelled with in the same plane a few months earlier – again.\"On 2 May 1993, more than 100,000 Zambians came to Independence Stadium, where Zambia played their home matches, for a funeral.Most of those attending stayed in the streets because the stadium’s capacity was only 35,000.Following an all-night vigil and a service of remembrance the players were laid to rest in a semi-circle of graves.Each grave has a tree planted in front of it in a memorial garden called Heroes’ Acre, 100 metres to the north of the stadium.One commemorated the life of the legendary Godfrey Chitalu, a fabled goalscorer who became the team's coach.Another was dedicated to Bwalya’s room-mate, David ‘Effort’ Chabala, who had kept the clean sheet in the Olympic demolition of Italy.Twenty-three year-old Kelvin Mutale was also among the dead. Two-footed, good in the air and two years into his international career, he had emerged as Bwalya’s strike partner and had just scored all three goals in the win over Mauritius.“Derby Makinka was one of the best players that Zambia has ever produced in the number six position,” remembers Bwalya. “He was a tank.“We had a world-class player in every position.“I can still feel being in the changing room with the boys, I can still see the boys, how happy they were, and it’s a good past.\"",
        "Amid the shock and loss, a big question loomed: what would Zambia do now?Bwalya thought he knew.“I thought that Zambia was not going to play (again),” says Bwalya. “I was convinced that, there goes the ambition of us doing anything.\"But, a phone call from the country's president, convinced him otherwise. The search for a new team – to be built around Bwalya – was on.Twenty coaches gathered in Lusaka to give trials to 60 players. A squad of disparate hopefuls was then chosen and sent to Denmark for a six-week training camp at the expense of the Danish government.They were greeted at Copenhagen airport by their new, temporary coach.Roald Poulsen had pedigree. The 42-year-old had won both the Danish league title and cup with Odense, but his task of creating a competitive team for the World Cup qualifiers was formidable.“I had no clue what I was going to do,” he admits. “I had no idea about the players and no idea about the background, no idea about the society itself, anything about Zambian football.“I was a little bit worried when I saw the standard of the players. They didn’t know whether they were good enough.”The players had to adjust too. Most had never left Africa before. Poulsen had to reassure them a post-training jog through Danish forest was safe, explaining that the risk of a lion attack was lower than in Zambia.Bwalya found a group bonded by a common purpose and sense of duty.“Everybody felt like they had to do something extra for the fallen heroes,” says Bwalya. “You knew that, I am a replacement but I am doing it on behalf of somebody, I’m stepping in for somebody.”On 4 July, was their chance to step up.",
        "Almost exactly two months after the funerals, Zambia's 1994 World Cup qualifying campaign belatedly began against Morocco in Lusaka.“I was with the captain’s armband and we were lining up,” remembers Bwalya.“I looked behind to see that everybody is in place. The first person behind me was always Effort Chabala. Now, I saw all new faces.\"After just 10 minutes, Morocco led through a spectacular goal by Rachid Daoudi. In the stands, the home fans called upon the past to help the present.“The people on the upper tier that faces the memorial site turned around and they started to appeal to their deceased players, their brothers,\" remembers journalist Ponga Liwewe.\"They said, 'can we, with your help, get back into the game?'”Zambia could.Just after the hour, Bwalya hit a magnificent equaliser from a free kick and within 10 minutes, Johnson Bwalya, no relation, won it with a second goal.“It felt like we had come back from the dead,” Liwewe says.“The whole nation was on its feet. We were resurrected. That’s an appropriate word to describe what we were feeling. We felt we can take on the world again.”Ultimately though they would fall short of the World Cup itself.Going into the final World Cup qualifier, away to Morocco in October 1993, all Zambia needed was a point to reach USA 1994.They lost 1-0.",
        "Six months later, they surprised everyone again, but suffered once more.Against the odds, they made the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations final against Nigeria.Elijah Litana gave Zambia the lead in the fourth minute, but two goals from the Super Eagles' Emmanuel Amunike wrestled the title out of the Copper Bullets' grasp.In less than a year, Zambia had lost a team, fashioned another, and come agonisingly close to both World Cup qualification and Afcon triumph.\"It was a year that you had to age 10 years in order to fit in exactly what had happened,” reflects Bwalya.“The fallen heroes, wherever they were, they were looking upon us and saying, ‘Yeah, good effort. You guys are doing well. Keep going.’”Zambia would finish third in Afcon two years later and then retreat into obscurity for 16 years.",
        "Zambia's squad for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations was short on star power.Most of the players played in their domestic league, South Africa or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Captain Chris Katongo was based in China.Unsurprisingly, they were 40-1 outsiders to win it.Their coach was Frenchman Herve Renard, who had worked as a cleaner before breaking into football coaching. He was still to win a trophy after a decade in his new career.Yet, they defied expectations.Zambia topped a group containing a misfiring Senegal, saw off Sudan in the last eight, before a fine-counter-attacking performance upset Ghana in the semi-finals.The final would bring them face to face with the past.The tournament had co-hosts: Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. However, Zambia's path through the draw had, so far, kept them exclusively in Equatorial Guinea.“The only match we were going to play in Gabon, in Libreville, was the final,” says Bwalya, by then the President of Zambia's football association.The final was to be played less than 10 miles from where the 1993 team had perished off the Gabon coast.“I said to the coach, I think it’s better that we make a connection so that the old team meets the new team,” says Bwalya.“I made it known that, when we arrived, the first thing that we were going to do was visit the site.”Three days before the final, Bwalya, Katongo and Renard were among those who cast flowers into the surf where, two decades earlier, bodies, boots and bags had washed up.",
        "“When we moved out from the site of the plane crash, we were in the bus and I see players quiet a little bit,” says Katongo, who was 11 in 1993.“Even if somebody was listening to their music, there was something (else) that he was thinking and trying to digest.“From that moment, everybody said, 'this is it guys. We just need to work as a team to achieve what these people wanted to achieve who perished here in Gabon.'”Bwalya too could see that the players’ mindset had shifted.“The boys believed that they are not only playing for themselves, that they’re also playing for the fallen heroes and that meant a lot more than just playing in the final.\"Renard's pre-match team talk did not focus on Didier Drogba, Yaya Toure or any of Ivory Coast’s other stars. It didn't focus on tactics.Instead, it was all about what they had experienced together on the beach.“Think about all the players and all the people who were in this plane and died for your country,” he told the players.“Think about their families, think about your country. We have to do it. We can’t miss this fantastic chance.”The game matched his speech for drama.In the second half, with the game still scoreless, Drogba, at the peak of his Chelsea powers, smashed a penalty over the bar.Extra-time couldn't divide the teams either.Both side converted their first seven penalties.Both missed their eighth.",
        "But finally, with a kick to win it, Zambia's Stoppila Sunzu strode to the spot.The defender sang a song of praise as he prepared to start his run-up, slipped just before connecting with the ball, but still buried his shot into the bottom corner.His team-mates, who had been on their knees in prayer in the centre circle, burst forward to celebrate.Nineteen years previously, a plane had flown from Gabon to Zambia returning the dead to their final resting place.Now, another would made the same journey, carrying a golden trophy and a glory that transcended generations.",

        "The final would bring them face to face with the past.",
        "The tournament had co-hosts: Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. However, Zambia's path through the draw had, so far, kept them exclusively in Equatorial Guinea.",
        "“The only match we were going to play in Gabon, in Libreville, was the final,” says Bwalya, by then the President of Zambia's football association.",
        "The final was to be played less than 10 miles from where the 1993 team had perished off the Gabon coast.",
        "“I said to the coach, I think it’s better that we make a connection so that the old team meets the new team,” says Bwalya.",
        "“I made it known that, when we arrived, the first thing that we were going to do was visit the site.”",

        "Captain Chris Katongo said that the act of remembrance and tribute was \"too much\" for some of his team-mates",
        "“When we moved out from the site of the plane crash, we were in the bus and I see players quiet a little bit,” says Katongo, who was 11 in 1993.",
        "“Even if somebody was listening to their music, there was something (else) that he was thinking and trying to digest.",
        "“From that moment, everybody said, 'this is it guys. We just need to work as a team to achieve what these people wanted to achieve who perished here in Gabon.'”",
        "Bwalya too could see that the players’ mindset had shifted.",
        "“The boys believed that they are not only playing for themselves, that they’re also playing for the fallen heroes and that meant a lot more than just playing in the final.\"",
        "Renard's pre-match team talk did not focus on Didier Drogba, Yaya Toure or any of Ivory Coast’s other stars. It didn't focus on tactics.",

        "“Think about all the players and all the people who were in this plane and died for your country,” he told the players.",

        "The game matched his speech for drama.",
        "In the second half, with the game still scoreless, Drogba, at the peak of his Chelsea powers, smashed a penalty over the bar.",
        "Extra-time couldn't divide the teams either.",

The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.Interviews will drop on Saturdays across BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week's interview will be broadcast on BBC One from 23:35 BST on Saturday, 25 October (and after Sportscene in Scotland).",
        "Reece James started training with Chelsea at the age of six and - having progressed through the academy and into the first team - is now club captain.James announced himself to the Stamford Bridge faithful in style, scoring on his debut in a 7-1 win over Grimsby Town in September 2019.Now 25, James' career highlights so far include making his England debut against Wales in 2020, winning the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021, and being appointed club captain in 2023.However, things have not always gone smoothly, with a series of injuries affecting him over the past four seasons.James sat down with Kelly Somers to talk about his career highs, Thiago Silva's influence, and his friendship with seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton.",
        "Kelly Somers: First question: name, where you're from, and what's your coffee order?Reece James: The name is Reece James, I grew up in Mortlake, near Richmond - I'm sure more people will know that area. My coffee is a flat white.Kelly: Has it always been a flat white?Reece: No, it started with, like, vanilla lattes and stuff.Kelly: Let's start by talking football. What does football mean to you?Reece: I mean, from a little kid, it's kind of all I knew in school. I wasn't the brightest kid, and I just loved playing football.Kelly: What's your earliest memory of playing? Is this tough to answer because it was such a big part of your kind of childhood and growing up?Reece: No, just because my memory is so bad. My earliest memory was probably, I don't know, going to watch my brother play. He's two years older than me, and he used to play as well.Kelly: It was big in your household, wasn't it, because your dad was was so heavily involved? He's a football coach too, isn't he? Tell me a bit about that.Reece: So there was three of us growing up. It was all football mad, and he obviously was a coach as well, and we used to train a lot with him.Kelly: Do you remember a lot of those sessions? Because I read that as young as the age of four, you were outside and he was doing drills with you in the back garden.Reece: Yeah, I remember - the drills started young. Thankfully, they paid off for me and my sister [Chelsea and England forward Lauren James].Kelly: Talk to me about your first ever team that you played for as a youngster, what was it called, and what can you remember?Reece: I don't remember much, to be honest. It was Kew Park Rangers in Kew. I think I was there for about a year. It was from there that I was scouted for Chelsea. Kelly: And you weren't a defender at first, were you? Talk to me about your positional journey and how that changed...Reece: I started off as a striker, and then eventually moved to the wing, left wing, right wing, and eventually to midfield, and then eventually at right-back, and I hated it at the time.Kelly: Why did you hate it?Reece: Because I always wanted to play midfield. You didn't touch the ball as much but one day it just clicked and I've been a right-back since.",
        "Kelly: You said you started as as a forward - who was your idol?Reece: My idol was [Didier] Drogba. I was a Chelsea fan growing up and he was the player I looked up to.Kelly: Can you think of a turning point in your career - a moment that has shaped you and the player you have become?Reece: I would probably say going on loan. Bridging the gap between academy and first-team football is the hardest and that is probably what most players making the  jump find challenging.Kelly: You're talking about Wigan, of course. Why was Wigan the right club for you at the time? It was miles away from everything you knew in London - why did it work so well?Reece: The first thing is that I played week in week out, which helps. I gained a lot of experiences - I moved away from my friends and family and had to grow up fast. Playing on a consistent basis helped a lot.Kelly: Who has had the biggest impact on your career? Reece: I would say [Brazil defender] Thiago Silva. He is nearly old enough to be my dad and has played at the highest level for so long. He always tried to help me from the minute he arrived and still does, even now he is not here [having left Chelsea in 2024].Kelly: In what way would he help you? Reece: It was little messages off the pitch. On the pitch, he would sometimes see things that I saw differently and try and paint a different picture.Kelly: It must have been nice to see him this summer [at the Club World Cup]?Reece: It was great to see him again. I'm happy that his team did well in the tournament [they lost in the semi-finals to eventual winners Chelsea]. It is always good to see him.Kelly: If you could go back and replay one match in your career, which would you pick? Reece: If the outcome is going to be the same - it would be the Champions League [final].Kelly: Other than winning, what was so special about that night?Reece: Not many people expected us to win. [Manchester] City were favourites. The way the game went, 1-0 in the final - they had chances but they didn't take them. It is the biggest trophy in club football.Kelly: It was a similar situation with the Club World Cup with lots of people talking about PSG and the way you won that...Reece: It was another final where we were underdogs but we all believed and knew we were good enough to come out on top. I think we showed that in the game and with the result.Kelly: What was a typical day for you and your siblings growing up?Reece: We would wake up and go to school. The minute we got home from school, it was kicking a ball around on the street until one of us had to go to training. Whoever was training, the other one would be kicking a ball around on the side watching. It was like that for pretty much all of my childhood, always with a ball at my feet.Kelly: What was it like growing up with your sister Lauren? It must have been so evident from a young age how good she was...Reece: When she was young, I didn't understand how good she was because I didn't see that many girls playing. She always played with me and boys and she was better than most of them. She has come on leaps and bounds in her career and is doing amazing things.Kelly: I read she was training with the Arsenal women's team and was then moved to the Arsenal boys' academy. She talked about the fact that she didn't think about being any different as a girl, she was a footballer. That must have been something that playing with you and your brother must have really helped her with...Reece: Yeah she was always playing with the both of us and that probably helped her with her technical ability and physicality.Kelly: What's your relationship like with her now?Reece: It's good. We live a similar life - we're playing football at the highest level. Sometimes our schedules are not aligned so we miss each other's games, but we are close.Kelly: Do you speak a lot and see each other a lot?Reece: I'm always travelling, she's always travelling. We speak a lot.",
        "Kelly: What does a typical day off look like for you, if you're having a day away from football?Reece: If it's pre-season I'm not leaving the house, because I'm tired. I'd literally be in bed all day. If it's in season, I'd probably go into London with my friends, see what they're up to.Kelly: How do you escape, because football is so intense?Reece: When I get home, I just try not to think too much, take things in my stride.Kelly: Fashion is a big thing for you, you like a fashion show?Reece: I like a fashion show, yeah, depending on the time of year. Fashion is good - it's something I am interested in and enjoy.Kelly: How would you describe your fashion sense?Reece: Now it's a lot more chilled. A few years ago, it was a bit more edgy.Kelly: Is that down to maturing?Reece: Maybe boredom!Kelly: How would your friends describe you? You come across super laid back. Would they say the same?Reece: Most of the time, yeah. I have a sharper side as well. Not everything goes my way. Sometimes I'm not in the mood, and they see that more than other people.Kelly: Has your personality changed as you've got older and everything you've gone through?Reece: Yeah, a lot. I've had a lot of disappointment, setbacks. That changes the way you think and view things.Kelly: Do you think becoming a captain has changed you as well?Reece: Yeah, it's benefited me - it's helped me grow as a person. I need to help the younger team-mates and try and improve them as players and as people.Kelly: How would team-mates describe you?Reece: Why don't we pull one of them in! That would be slightly easier. They'd probably say I'm chilled as well.Kelly: But you're not chilled on the pitch, I've seen you play. It seems like there is a very different Reece James sitting here to Reece James the captain.Reece: I'm not sure what happens. It's all or nothing on the pitch, and then off the pitch it's like whatever happens, happens.Kelly: Your friendship with Lewis Hamilton... he posted congratulations to you. It wasn't sent from someone just observing, it was from someone that clearly knows you. Talk to me about that relationship with him.Reece: We're reasonably close. He's probably the greatest F1 driver to have lived. I know we play different sports, but there are many similarities. He tries to help me where he can, when I'm going through difficult spells, because he has been at a high level for longer, and he's been through more.Kelly: How did you get to know each other?Reece: Through a mutual friend, and then we have been in contact since.Kelly: What are you most proud of?Reece: Probably the trophies I have won for the club.Kelly: Any one in particular?Reece: I wouldn't pick, they all play a huge part together.Kelly: Tell me something that people get wrong about you the most.Reece: I don't know, to be honest. A lot of people say a lot of stuff. Everyone has their opinion, but it doesn't really bother me. I don't know if I see anything, I'm not really paying attention anyway.Kelly: If you could only achieve one more thing for the rest of your career, what would it be?Reece: To win the World Cup.",

        "Reece James started training with Chelsea at the age of six and - having progressed through the academy and into the first team - is now club captain.",
        "James announced himself to the Stamford Bridge faithful in style, scoring on his debut in a 7-1 win over Grimsby Town in September 2019.",
        "Now 25, James' career highlights so far include making his England debut against Wales in 2020, winning the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021, and being appointed club captain in 2023.",
        "However, things have not always gone smoothly, with a series of injuries affecting him over the past four seasons.",
        "James sat down with Kelly Somers to talk about his career highs, Thiago Silva's influence, and his friendship with seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton.",

        "Kelly Somers: First question: name, where you're from, and what's your coffee order?",
        "Reece James: The name is Reece James, I grew up in Mortlake, near Richmond - I'm sure more people will know that area. My coffee is a flat white.",
        "Kelly: Has it always been a flat white?",
        "Reece: No, it started with, like, vanilla lattes and stuff.",
        "Kelly: Let's start by talking football. What does football mean to you?",
        "Reece: I mean, from a little kid, it's kind of all I knew in school. I wasn't the brightest kid, and I just loved playing football.",
        "Kelly: What's your earliest memory of playing? Is this tough to answer because it was such a big part of your kind of childhood and growing up?",
        "Reece: No, just because my memory is so bad. My earliest memory was probably, I don't know, going to watch my brother play. He's two years older than me, and he used to play as well.",
        "Kelly: It was big in your household, wasn't it, because your dad was was so heavily involved? He's a football coach too, isn't he? Tell me a bit about that.",
        "Reece: So there was three of us growing up. It was all football mad, and he obviously was a coach as well, and we used to train a lot with him.",
        "Kelly: Do you remember a lot of those sessions? Because I read that as young as the age of four, you were outside and he was doing drills with you in the back garden.",
        "Reece: Yeah, I remember - the drills started young. Thankfully, they paid off for me and my sister [Chelsea and England forward Lauren James].",
        "Kelly: Talk to me about your first ever team that you played for as a youngster, what was it called, and what can you remember?",
        "Reece: I don't remember much, to be honest. It was Kew Park Rangers in Kew. I think I was there for about a year. It was from there that I was scouted for Chelsea.",
        "Kelly: And you weren't a defender at first, were you? Talk to me about your positional journey and how that changed...",
        "Reece: I started off as a striker, and then eventually moved to the wing, left wing, right wing, and eventually to midfield, and then eventually at right-back, and I hated it at the time.",
        "Kelly: Why did you hate it?",
        "Reece: Because I always wanted to play midfield. You didn't touch the ball as much but one day it just clicked and I've been a right-back since.",
        "Reece James won the Champions League in 2021 when Chelsea beat Man City 1-0 in the final in Porto",
        "Kelly: You said you started as as a forward - who was your idol?",
        "Reece: My idol was [Didier] Drogba. I was a Chelsea fan growing up and he was the player I looked up to.",
        "Kelly: Can you think of a turning point in your career - a moment that has shaped you and the player you have become?",
        "Reece: I would probably say going on loan. Bridging the gap between academy and first-team football is the hardest and that is probably what most players making the  jump find challenging.",
        "Kelly: You're talking about Wigan, of course. Why was Wigan the right club for you at the time? It was miles away from everything you knew in London - why did it work so well?",
        "Reece: The first thing is that I played week in week out, which helps. I gained a lot of experiences - I moved away from my friends and family and had to grow up fast. Playing on a consistent basis helped a lot.",
        "Kelly: Who has had the biggest impact on your career?",
        "Reece: I would say [Brazil defender] Thiago Silva. He is nearly old enough to be my dad and has played at the highest level for so long. He always tried to help me from the minute he arrived and still does, even now he is not here [having left Chelsea in 2024].",
        "Kelly: In what way would he help you?",
        "Reece: It was little messages off the pitch. On the pitch, he would sometimes see things that I saw differently and try and paint a different picture.",
        "Kelly: It must have been nice to see him this summer [at the Club World Cup]?",
        "Reece: It was great to see him again. I'm happy that his team did well in the tournament [they lost in the semi-finals to eventual winners Chelsea]. It is always good to see him.",

        "With Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke, Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz among the creative players currently sidelined with injuries, Arsenal's attack may well improve as the season goes on.But if it doesn't, will their defence be enough to lift the top-flight trophy for the first time since 2004?Of the 33 sides to win the Premier League, only six have won it conceding the fewest goals and not scoring the most (18%).The last team to succeed in such fashion was Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool in 2019-20, who ended their 30-year title wait despite scoring 17 goals fewer than Manchester City's 102 that season.",

      "topic": "Kane can't stop scoring - is the Ballon d'Or within reach?",
      "content": [
        "Earlier this year Harry Kane finally ended his trophy drought in the 15th season of his professional career when Bayern Munich were crowned Bundesliga champions.It paved the way for him to target other major prizes, for club, country and himself.Despite being in the form of his life, the England striker ranked only 13th in September at the 2025 Ballon d'Or awards and has never finished higher than 10th in the prestigious list.In the month since Paris St-Germain's Ousmane Dembele was named the world's best player in Paris, it feels like Kane has elevated his game to an even higher, previously unthinkable level.The 32-year-old took his goal tally this season to 20 in 12 club games in all competitions as Bayern Munich beat Club Brugge 4-0 in the Champions League.Kane is well aware that maintaining his scoring run, winning Europe's biggest club competition, and helping England triumph at the World Cup next summer, will make him a frontrunner for the 2026 Ballon d'Or.\"I would love to win it for sure, it would be an accumulation of doing something great individually and as a team,\" said the former Tottenham Hotspur hero earlier this month. \"It would be almost the perfect season.\"The last English player to win the coveted prize was striker Michael Owen in 2001, when he starred for Liverpool. There have been only three others - Stanley Matthews (1956), Bobby Charlton (1966) and Kevin Keegan (1978, 1979).Could Kane become the fifth, and finally gain recognition for his astonishing scoring feats, or will European football's new generation of talent get in his way?",
        "Given how he has started his third campaign with Bayern, this could be the best chance he ever has.In September, Kane became the fastest player this century to reach 100 goals for a club playing in one of Europe's top five leagues in just 104 games, and has now netted 105 times in 108 matches.No other player in Europe's top five leagues has scored that many since the start of 2023-24.Neither Lionel Messi nor Cristiano Ronaldo reached 20 goals in a season faster than Kane - they needed 17 and 13 respectively - and England's record scorer is averaging a goal every 54 minutes.Having already netted 12 times in seven Bundesliga outings this term, he is on track to score 58 goals.Kane needs another 30 in the remaining 27 games to break Robert Lewandowski's record total of 41 goals in a single Bundesliga season.It's a similar story in Europe. Since his first Champions League match for Bayern in September 2023, he has scored more goals (24) and been directly involved in more goals (24 goals and six assists) than any other player in the competition.Only Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy scored more goals in his first 60 games in the competition (48).",
        "But there is more to Kane's Ballon d'Or case than just goals - the work he does on and off the ball when dropping off the forward line is unmatched by other elite goalscorers.\"Kane has reinvented the centre-forward game, as Manuel Neuer did with goalkeepers about a decade and a half ago,\" 1990 Ballon d'Or winner Lothar Matthaus wrote in his column for Sky Germany., external\"I don't see a better striker in the world right now. Not just because of his goals, but because of his versatility and the positions he plays.\"Kane also demonstrates qualities as a passer, dribbler, and tackler. He is simultaneously a goalscorer, playmaker, box-to-box player, and tackler.\"The way Kane brings others into games while also maintaining his incredible scoring record does not go unnoticed by his team-mates either.\"Harry makes you better - he is not here just to finish, he will put you in front of the goal,\" his former Bayern team-mate Kingsley Coman said on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast earlier this year.\"I feel like he enjoys finding a really nice pass as much as scoring. What is amazing is that he can do both. He is one of the strikers who is easiest to play with.\"People say if your striker is selfish then there is a problem. But Harry is not selfish and he bangs in 40 goals or more a season.\"After Jamal Musiala's leg and ankle break in the summer cost Bayern their main creative force, manager Vincent Kompany tweaked Kane's role to give him near-total attacking freedom on the pitch.\"He is playing like three or four different players on the pitch at the same time, and that makes him so invaluable,\" said Raphael Honigstein on the BBC Football Daily Euro Leagues podcast.Mina Rzouki added: \"His intellect is on another level, his sacrifice for the team is on another level.\"",
        "Kane, though, is not the only in-form striker looking to be named the best player on the planet.Erling Haaland has scored 24 goals in 14 games for Manchester City and Norway this season, while Kylian Mbappe has 18 in 14 outings for Real Madrid and France.Including his recent England goals, Kane has 23 in 15.While Haaland has scored in 12 consecutive matches and Mbappe's recent run ended at 11, Matthaus feels neither contribute across the pitch quite like Kane.\"I've never seen Haaland and Mbappe slide in their own penalty area like Kane did in the 88th minute against [Borussia] Dortmund,\" he wrote after Kane's all-action performance in Bayern's recent 2-1 win in Der Klassiker.\"I also don't see Haaland and Mbappe make passes of 50 metres or more. I haven't seen the chip shots that Kane can play from the other two.\"On the occasions Messi and Ronaldo haven't won the Ballon d'Or, though, the winner tends to be someone from a team that has tasted success in the Champions League, Euros or World Cup.\"It is a team trophy that the best individual from that team wins,\" admitted Kane.\"But if I keep doing what I am doing and we have a successful season with club and country then there is a chance to do that.\"With an impressive three wins out of three, Bayern have every chance in this season's Champions League, while England qualified for the 2026 World Cup with six successive group wins - providing hope that this could be the time Kane is able to celebrate that \"perfect season\".",

      "content": [
        "Sheffield Wednesday have been placed in administration - but what does that mean?When a company, such as a sports club, becomes insolvent - meaning it can no longer pay its debts - directors can choose to appoint administrators to assess whether it can carry on operating, or if it needs to be sold.Administrators are accountants licensed in insolvency cases, and can also be appointed by a court if it is proven a club is insolvent.Responsibility for running the club - other than what happens on the pitch - is passed from the owners to the administrators for a 12-month administration period which is automatic, though can be shortened or extended if needed.After a period of administration, a club will either have been saved, gone into liquidation, or been dissolved.As well as meaning the future of the club is assessed, being placed into administration protects the club by enforcing something called a statutory moratorium. This temporarily shields the club from legal action by debtors while financial restructuring plans are prepared by administrators.",
        "The most immediate impact for a football club of entering administration is a large points deduction.Sheffield Wednesday have been docked 12 points, which is the penalty set by the EFL for clubs entering administration. They were already bottom of the table, but are now even further adrift.Derby County, in 2021, were the last EFL club to enter administration, and were also docked 12 points.Portsmouth are the only team to have entered administration while in the Premier League. They were deducted 10 points in 2010.In addition to points deductions, clubs may lose key players or facilities as administrators have the option to sell off assets to bring in money.",
        "There is a specific order in which football club creditors must be repaid.'Football super creditors' are top of the hierarchy. That includes players, managers, outstanding transfer fees to other clubs, the Professional Footballers' Association, and the Premier League or EFL.That can leave other suppliers - such as hospitality or utilities - and club staff left with money owed to them.If the club cannot pay the 'super creditors', it may be forced into liquidation, spelling the end of the club.That happened to Scarborough in 2007 and Chester City in 2010. Both clubs reformed - as Scarborough Athletic FC and Chester FC respectively.Rangers FC entered liquidation in 2012 and were dissolved, restarting under new ownership in the fourth tier of Scottish football.If enough money is brought in through the administration process - potentially by new owners - clubs can continue to operate.This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.",

      "content": [
        "Villarreal say they have been shown \"a complete and utter lack of respect\" by La Liga over the cancellation of their overseas match against Barcelona in the United States.In August, the Spanish football federation (RFEF) approved plans to move Villarreal's fixture against Barcelona to Miami's Hard Rock Stadium on 20 December.However, the decision was reversed on Tuesday after the move sparked a backlash, with top-flight players refusing to move for the first 15 seconds of La Liga matches last weekend in protest.Villarreal say they were due to have a meeting this Thursday and were prepared to pull out of the fixture over a lack of communication and poor organisation - and were then told of the decision to cancel the game \"minutes before\" their Champions League match against Manchester City.A club statement, external said: \"Villarreal wishes to express its deep displeasure with La  Liga for the poor managemant of the match which ultimately will not be played in  the United States.\"Minutes before kick-off against Manchester City the club was notified by phone by La Liga that the match was cancelled. However, the information was confidential and the best time would be sought to communicate it jointly.\"Minutes later, and to the club's surprise, La Liga decided to issue a unilateral statement announcing the cancellation of a match involving Villarreal during a match of such importance to the club, demonstrating a complete and utter lack of respect for the club, as well as a lack of sensitivity and empathy.\"Villarreal said they accepted the match on the condition that season ticket holders would be financially compensated for missing the Barcelona game and given free travel to Miami.The Spanish league's president Javier Tebas says the cancellation of the game is a blow to the competition. \"Today, Spanish football has lost an opportunity to advance, project itself globally, and strengthen its future,\" Tebas wrote on X. \"The defence of 'tradition' is invoked from a narrow-minded and provincial perspective, while the true traditions of European football are threatened by decisions by the governing institutions, which year after year destroy national leagues. \"La Liga will continue working, with rigour and conviction, to keep Spanish football competitive, standing up to those who seek to destroy it, but always respecting its roots and ensuring its sustainability.\"Despite their criticisms of the handling of the match, Villarreal said the game's cancellation is a missed opportunity.\"Villarreal regrets that La Liga, as the organiser, did not better manage the management of the match and that the La Liga match in Miami could not be held,\" they said.\"It is a good opportunity for the growth of the clubs and La Liga internationally.\"",
        "Tebas added that Spanish football \"deserved to look to the future with ambition, not fear\" and that the league will continue attempt to play matches overseas. Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said his players were \"not happy\" with the initial decision, while Real Madrid captain Dani Carvajal said an overseas game would be a \"stain\" on the competition.The decision to cancel the match in Miami was announced during Villarreal's 2-0 Champions League defeat at home by Manchester City.It would have been the first time a European top-flight league match had taken place in the United States, although the Spanish Super Cup has been held in Saudi Arabia in four of the past five seasons.Fans' group Football Supporters Europe said the levels of opposition against La Liga's plans had been \"deafening\" \"La Liga's defeat sends a clear message to the world of football: such ill-conceived projects are doomed to fail. These attempts to destabilise the foundation of the game must stop now,\" a statement read. The Italian football federation followed La Liga in announcing an overseas game, with the Serie A match between AC Milan and Como set to be played in Perth, Australia, in February.",
        "When La Liga announced plans to stage a league fixture between Villarreal and Barcelona in Miami, it presented the idea as a bold step forward - one that would elevate the visibility of Spanish football, enhance the profile of its players, and strengthen the sport's brand in a key international market.The project, fully compliant with federation regulations and competition integrity, was envisioned as a new frontier for a game seeking global relevance.But the controversy that followed showed just how far Spanish football still is from speaking with one voice.The way the cancellation was handled has left deep marks. Villarreal felt blind-sided, saying the timing damaged their image and that of the competition. \"We found out 10 minutes before kick-off [in Tuesday's home Champions League game against Manchester City],\" one senior figure said.Among the most vocal critics were the players themselves - arguing not against the concept, but against the process. They had been asking for months how logistics would work: Would there be 72 hours of rest between fixtures, as agreed? Would insurance cover them abroad? What is the payment distribution?When answers never came, teams staged symbolic protests. Their message was simple: Listen to us.Across Spain, opposition built quickly. Many clubs voiced doubts, the media questioned the transparency and logic of the project, and details about how - or whether - clubs would be compensated remained unclear. Villarreal even stated publicly that they weren't receiving any money from the deal, while Barcelona insisted they were being paid from the moment they boarded the plane to Miami.Meanwhile, Real Madrid intensified their opposition, filing a second complaint with Spain's national sports council (CSD) to block the Miami match. The club argued that playing a league game abroad would \"violate competitive fairness\".A new debate has started. It is one thing to alter the competition, another to adulterate or corrupt it - La Liga accepts the first suggestion, but not the second.Amid this legal and institutional tug-of-war, the Spanish federation offered its support, while the government trod cautiously through the regulatory maze, waiting to see how events unfolded.For La Liga, Villarreal and Barca, the refusal to move forward represents more than just one cancelled match: it's a setback in the effort to build new revenue streams and maintain international competitiveness.The league insisted the project aimed to generate long-term value for all stakeholders - clubs, players, and fans - by opening new commercial and sporting avenues abroad. It emphasised that international expansion remains vital to ensure Spanish football's global relevance.The Miami experiment has shown that Spanish football, for all its talent and ambition, is not yet ready to make that leap - into a future that feels irresistible for some, and unstoppable for many.",

        "\"Minutes before kick-off against Manchester City the club was notified by phone by La Liga that the match was cancelled. However, the information was confidential and the best time would be sought to communicate it jointly.",
        "\"Minutes later, and to the club's surprise, La Liga decided to issue a unilateral statement announcing the cancellation of a match involving Villarreal during a match of such importance to the club, demonstrating a complete and utter lack of respect for the club, as well as a lack of sensitivity and empathy.\"",
        "Villarreal said they accepted the match on the condition that season ticket holders would be financially compensated for missing the Barcelona game and given free travel to Miami.",
        "The Spanish league's president Javier Tebas says the cancellation of the game is a blow to the competition.",
        "\"Today, Spanish football has lost an opportunity to advance, project itself globally, and strengthen its future,\" Tebas wrote on X.",
        "\"The defence of 'tradition' is invoked from a narrow-minded and provincial perspective, while the true traditions of European football are threatened by decisions by the governing institutions, which year after year destroy national leagues.",
        "\"La Liga will continue working, with rigour and conviction, to keep Spanish football competitive, standing up to those who seek to destroy it, but always respecting its roots and ensuring its sustainability.\"",
        "Despite their criticisms of the handling of the match, Villarreal said the game's cancellation is a missed opportunity.",
        "\"Villarreal regrets that La Liga, as the organiser, did not better manage the management of the match and that the La Liga match in Miami could not be held,\" they said.",
        "\"It is a good opportunity for the growth of the clubs and La Liga internationally.\"",
        "Tebas added that Spanish football \"deserved to look to the future with ambition, not fear\" and that the league will continue attempt to play matches overseas.",
        "Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said his players were \"not happy\" with the initial decision, while Real Madrid captain Dani Carvajal said an overseas game would be a \"stain\" on the competition.",
        "The decision to cancel the match in Miami was announced during Villarreal's 2-0 Champions League defeat at home by Manchester City.",
        "It would have been the first time a European top-flight league match had taken place in the United States, although the Spanish Super Cup has been held in Saudi Arabia in four of the past five seasons.",
        "Fans' group Football Supporters Europe said the levels of opposition against La Liga's plans had been \"deafening\"",
        "\"La Liga's defeat sends a clear message to the world of football: such ill-conceived projects are doomed to fail. These attempts to destabilise the foundation of the game must stop now,\" a statement read.",
        "The Italian football federation followed La Liga in announcing an overseas game, with the Serie A match between AC Milan and Como set to be played in Perth, Australia, in February.",
        "When La Liga announced plans to stage a league fixture between Villarreal and Barcelona in Miami, it presented the idea as a bold step forward - one that would elevate the visibility of Spanish football, enhance the profile of its players, and strengthen the sport's brand in a key international market.",
        "The project, fully compliant with federation regulations and competition integrity, was envisioned as a new frontier for a game seeking global relevance.",
        "But the controversy that followed showed just how far Spanish football still is from speaking with one voice.",
        "The way the cancellation was handled has left deep marks. Villarreal felt blind-sided, saying the timing damaged their image and that of the competition. \"We found out 10 minutes before kick-off [in Tuesday's home Champions League game against Manchester City],\" one senior figure said.",
        "Among the most vocal critics were the players themselves - arguing not against the concept, but against the process. They had been asking for months how logistics would work: Would there be 72 hours of rest between fixtures, as agreed? Would insurance cover them abroad? What is the payment distribution?",
        "When answers never came, teams staged symbolic protests. Their message was simple: Listen to us.",
        "Across Spain, opposition built quickly. Many clubs voiced doubts, the media questioned the transparency and logic of the project, and details about how - or whether - clubs would be compensated remained unclear. Villarreal even stated publicly that they weren't receiving any money from the deal, while Barcelona insisted they were being paid from the moment they boarded the plane to Miami.",
        "Meanwhile, Real Madrid intensified their opposition, filing a second complaint with Spain's national sports council (CSD) to block the Miami match. The club argued that playing a league game abroad would \"violate competitive fairness\".",
        "A new debate has started. It is one thing to alter the competition, another to adulterate or corrupt it - La Liga accepts the first suggestion, but not the second.",
        "Amid this legal and institutional tug-of-war, the Spanish federation offered its support, while the government trod cautiously through the regulatory maze, waiting to see how events unfolded.",
        "For La Liga, Villarreal and Barca, the refusal to move forward represents more than just one cancelled match: it's a setback in the effort to build new revenue streams and maintain international competitiveness.",
        "The league insisted the project aimed to generate long-term value for all stakeholders - clubs, players, and fans - by opening new commercial and sporting avenues abroad. It emphasised that international expansion remains vital to ensure Spanish football's global relevance.",
        "The Miami experiment has shown that Spanish football, for all its talent and ambition, is not yet ready to make that leap - into a future that feels irresistible for some, and unstoppable for many.",

      "topic": "What did we learn from Rohl's Rangers unveiling?",
      "content": [
        "Just over four and a half months on from Russell Martin's first press conference as Rangers head coach, his successor Danny Rohl faced the media at Ibrox for the first time.The size of the task he has ahead is well documented, given Martin's chaotic and unsuccessful 123-day tenure.The former Sheffield Wednesday manager was accompanied by chairman Andrew Cavenagh, and the much maligned duo of sporting director Kevin Thelwell and chief executive Patrick Stewart.But what exactly did we learn from the 36-year-old German's first public outing as Rangers boss?",
        "One thing emerged loud and clear from Rohl's first appearance in front of the Scottish media - he knows he needs to win matches, and win them quickly.  His predecessor Martin lasted only 17 matches and 123 days in charge, so I wondered what kind of timeframe the new man thinks is reasonable for him to turn around the tanker Martin once famously referred to.   While deftly avoiding a direct answer that might bring pressure further down the line, Rohl's message was pretty clear. \"Hopefully as soon as possible,\" he said. \"This is crucial. \"In this business you have not so much time. You can speak about the long-term vision but we know it's about the short-term and the short-term is about winning games. This is what I demand.\"One thing is also clear - I need all the players to understand how we want to play. I come back to my big headline: it's winning, it's attractive and it's together. If you do this in that order, I'm convinced that I will stay very long here.\"",
        "Martin required a police escort to exit the Falkirk Stadium after his last game in charge. We've seen how toxic things can become at football clubs when things are not going well. Protests have almost become an essential part of the matchday experience on both sides of Glasgow these days.As Rangers' youngest ever head coach, I asked Rohl what qualities he thinks he possesses that would enable him to cope, never mind thrive, in one of the most highly pressurised jobs in British football?\"I think pressure in this business is usual,\" he said. \"You have to learn that very quickly. \"I think some guys will maybe speak about my age but I'm 16 years down this path.    I had a great opportunity to work with Bayern Munich and be just the assistant coach, but I felt what it means to be a head coach and the pressure you have.  \"You start winning games and then some people will say you have to play nice football. That's the next part but that's exactly what I want to have. I enjoy that and  I'm looking forward to the future.\"",
        "There were plenty of questions from the media pack for Thelwell.  Much has been made of the appointment of his son Robbie as head of recruitment, with fans unconvinced he is qualified for the role.However, he defended and explained the decision to bring Thelwell Jnr to Ibrox.\"It's always uncomfortable to hear and optically I think we all agreed when we made this step to appoint Robbie that he was going to be seen in a particular way,\" Thelwell said. \"The reality of the situation is that we want to bring the very best talent here to Rangers. \"My view on Robbie's career and situation is he didn't need my help in football.\"He's worked at Aston Villa as a senior scout, he then moved to Norwich City as head of scouting and then got promoted to player pathways manager.  \"Before we recruited him, two Premier League clubs wanted to take him. What we did right at the start of the process was talk to Patrick, Andrew and [vice-chairman] Paraag Marathe about this situation.  \"I was extremely transparent and I think Robbie probably went through a more rigorous process than anybody else who's employed by this football club. \"What I do know is that he will work 25/8 to be successful in this football club and  I'm looking forward to him proving that he's going to be an excellent employee for Rangers.\"Thelwell also defended the signing of striker Youssef Chermiti, who arrived at Rangers for a reported initial fee of £8m, having failed to score in 24 appearances for Everton.It was Thelwell who brought the Portuguese youth international to Merseyside from Sporting - again for big money in a £15m deal.He was asked if he stands by his multi-million pound signing, who is yet to score in seven outings for the club.\"Yes, very much so,\" Thelwell said. \"I think Youssef Chermiti  is a player who's got huge potential. \"I've never doubted him in any way, shape or form. Again, I think Danny will help to get the best out of Youssef.  \"It's very early days for him, he's a young talent and of course with young talents they sometimes take a little bit of time.  \"But I'm certain over the course of his career here he's going to prove that he's a very, very good player.\"",
        "Stewart was also in the media firing line, given the vitriol that has been directed his way by some of the club's own supporters.   There was even a banner in the Sandy Jardine stand during the recent draw with Dundee United inviting him - and Thelwell - to pack his bags before they were packed for him. Like his sporting director, Stewart didn't duck the issue. \"I totally understand the frustration and hurt that the supporters are feeling because results this season haven't been good enough and nobody's happy with those,\" he said. \"The hurt and frustration they feel is mirrored within the boardroom.\"Also understand that there has to be an outlet for those frustrations and as chief executive, that's me.   \"I'm a lightning rod for those and my role as a leader is to absorb that, but also now to work harder and make sure that we turn this around. So we've got to earn that trust.\"",
        "Given his relative youth, and relative inexperience of the British game after less than two years in charge of Sheffield Wednesday,  this all went rather smoothly for Rohl.If he was nervous, he didn't show it, smiling broadly from start to finish and engaging quickly and eagerly with the assembled media.The famed German punctuality and efficiency was there right from the off, as he walked up to the top table in the press conference room at exactly 15:30, as advertised. He was expansive in his answers, speaking excellent English. His desire to win first then play nice football afterwards will go down well with supporters.   He was also clear that he's here to get down to business right away, no messing about. He was officially appointed late on Monday but has already taken his first training session and said he was delighted with the players' \"intensity\".He'd better get used to intensity. He's now front and centre in the glare of an unforgiving Glasgow spotlight. His side has given Celtic an eight point start, while Premiership leaders Hearts are 13 points clear of Rangers. There isn't a second to waste.  He told us he likes a challenge. Just as well.  He's now embarked on arguably the biggest one of his life so far.

      "topic": "'Rohl jumps from Wednesday frying pan into Rangers furnace'",
      "content": [
        "In the business of crisis management Danny Rohl served his apprenticeship at Sheffield Wednesday. As wacky a place as Wednesday was - and is - under the ownership of Thai tuna tycoon Dejphon Chansiri, the German's time there can be seen as an 89-game warm-up routine. From frying pan to furnace, Rohl is the new Rangers head coach.He becomes the eighth permanent manager/head coach of the Ibrox club in little over a decade and the 16th when you factor in all those interim guys who have drifted across their landscape.Only one of the previous seven Rangers managers has lasted 100 games - Steven Gerrard - with plenty of them considerably fewer than that. Russell Martin lasted 17, Pedro Caixinha was around for 26, Michael Beale survived for 43, Giovanni van Bronckhorst didn't get beyond 70 and Philippe Clement fell short of 90.Having withdrawn his interest in the job only last week - we wait to hear his explanation of what changed in the meantime - Rohl has now decided to join a club with rancour and uncertainty at every level, a third-choice candidate (that we know of) in a place that is under siege from angry fans.",
        "For the longest time, boardroom chaos was as much a part of Rangers as mascot Broxi Bear - a revolving door of owners, chairmen, chief executives, sporting directors and recruitment specialists.And, of course failed players, financial waste and precious few trophies. The new ownership was supposed to bring an end to the pandemonium, but it hasn't. There was supposed to be stability but instead there's wholesale unrest. And almost unprecedented amounts of fury.Chairman Andrew Cavenagh, vice-chairman Paraag Marathe, chief executive Patrick Stewart and sporting director Kevin Thelwell have pulled off the most extraordinary feat of taking a really poor team, investing £30m-£40m in it and making it worse.With their appointment of Martin, their failed pursuit of Gerrard and their slapstick move for Kevin Muscat, Stewart and Thelwell have been portrayed, on social media and elsewhere, as Laurel and Hardy, Dumb and Dumber and two ends of a pantomime horse. They are about as popular at Ibrox as a late Celtic winner.",
        "So, welcome to Glasgow, Danny. Hopefully you are arriving with your eyes wide open. You are now in charge of a team that many Rangers fans are saying is the worst in their lifetime and you have people at the top of the club - Stewart, Thelwell and Thelwell's son, Robbie - who the fans desperately want rid of. It seems they won't rest until those people are driven out.You saw what happened to your predecessor - escorted out of Falkirk Stadium by police on his final day in the job. You'll be given time - call it a game, maybe two - to show that you're improving things. The fans won't come for you in the same vicious way they came for the unwanted Martin - their sights are firmly fixed on those people above you - but best not anger them all the same.You have to assume that the transfer kitty, or most of it, has been spent, so don't hold out much hope of signing many players in January. Even if there was cash to splurge that job falls largely to Thelwell Snr, the operator who thought it good business to spend £8m on a striker who has scored three goals in more than 50 games in his career. Youssef Chermiti is only 21. Turning him into a goal machine will be high on Rohl's to-do list.Making silk purses of sow's ears might be too long a job description but that's a huge part of the role now. A case could easily be made that Rohl, with fewer than 100 games as a manager, has now accepted one of the toughest gigs in European or even world football.The incendiary nature of his new environment - the utter bedlam - is going to be a shock. He may think that he's prepared for it. Others thought that, too. For a decade the supporters have been counting them in and counting them back out again - and all of their frustration at having watched failed managers in the past tends to settle over the new guy like an ever-darkening cloud. It's not fair, but it's reality.",
        "The word on Rohl is wholly positive, though. Players talk at length about his many strengths. Barry Bannan says he's the best manager he's ever played for.It's not the same, but he has operated successfully in a demanding regime before. In Sheffield, before he was appointed, the team was in the grip of the worst league start in more than 150 years.He had an owner, Chansiri, who was, to put it kindly, eccentric.

        "From frying pan to furnace, Rohl is the new Rangers head coach.",
        "He becomes the eighth permanent manager/head coach of the Ibrox club in little over a decade and the 16th when you factor in all those interim guys who have drifted across their landscape.",
        "Only one of the previous seven Rangers managers has lasted 100 games - Steven Gerrard - with plenty of them considerably fewer than that.",
        "Russell Martin lasted 17, Pedro Caixinha was around for 26, Michael Beale survived for 43, Giovanni van Bronckhorst didn't get beyond 70 and Philippe Clement fell short of 90.",
        "Having withdrawn his interest in the job only last week - we wait to hear his explanation of what changed in the meantime - Rohl has now decided to join a club with rancour and uncertainty at every level, a third-choice candidate (that we know of) in a place that is under siege from angry fans.",

        "Is Rohl answer for Rangers? Or 'rinse and repeat'?",
        "What awaits new Rangers manager Rohl?",
        "For the longest time, boardroom chaos was as much a part of Rangers as mascot Broxi Bear - a revolving door of owners, chairmen, chief executives, sporting directors and recruitment specialists.",
        "And, of course failed players, financial waste and precious few trophies.",
        "The new ownership was supposed to bring an end to the pandemonium, but it hasn't. There was supposed to be stability but instead there's wholesale unrest. And almost unprecedented amounts of fury.",
        "Chairman Andrew Cavenagh, vice-chairman Paraag Marathe, chief executive Patrick Stewart and sporting director Kevin Thelwell have pulled off the most extraordinary feat of taking a really poor team, investing £30m-£40m in it and making it worse.",
        "With their appointment of Martin, their failed pursuit of Gerrard and their slapstick move for Kevin Muscat, Stewart and Thelwell have been portrayed, on social media and elsewhere, as Laurel and Hardy, Dumb and Dumber and two ends of a pantomime horse.",

        "So, welcome to Glasgow, Danny. Hopefully you are arriving with your eyes wide open.",
        "You are now in charge of a team that many Rangers fans are saying is the worst in their lifetime and you have people at the top of the club - Stewart, Thelwell and Thelwell's son, Robbie - who the fans desperately want rid of. It seems they won't rest until those people are driven out.",
        "You saw what happened to your predecessor - escorted out of Falkirk Stadium by police on his final day in the job.",
        "You'll be given time - call it a game, maybe two - to show that you're improving things.",
        "The fans won't come for you in the same vicious way they came for the unwanted Martin - their sights are firmly fixed on those people above you - but best not anger them all the same.",
        "You have to assume that the transfer kitty, or most of it, has been spent, so don't hold out much hope of signing many players in January.",
        "Even if there was cash to splurge that job falls largely to Thelwell Snr, the operator who thought it good business to spend £8m on a striker who has scored three goals in more than 50 games in his career. Youssef Chermiti is only 21. Turning him into a goal machine will be high on Rohl's to-do list.",
        "Making silk purses of sow's ears might be too long a job description but that's a huge part of the role now.",
        "A case could easily be made that Rohl, with fewer than 100 games as a manager, has now accepted one of the toughest gigs in European or even world football.",
        "The incendiary nature of his new environment - the utter bedlam - is going to be a shock.",
        "He may think that he's prepared for it. Others thought that, too.",
        "For a decade the supporters have been counting them in and counting them back out again - and all of their frustration at having watched failed managers in the past tends to settle over the new guy like an ever-darkening cloud.",

        "This video can not be played",
        "Rangers fans react to Danny Rohl appointment",
        "The word on Rohl is wholly positive, though. Players talk at length about his many strengths. Barry Bannan says he's the best manager he's ever played for.",
        "It's not the same, but he has operated successfully in a demanding regime before. In Sheffield, before he was appointed, the team was in the grip of the worst league start in more than 150 years.",
        "He had an owner, Chansiri, who was, to put it kindly, eccentric. He had fans in uproar over all manner of things. He had players who were not only demoralised but also unpaid at times.",

      "topic": "Keating's England debut & Le Tissier position dilemma",
      "content": [
        "A friendly defeat by Brazil wasn't the return home England's two-time European champions were looking for. Sarina Wiegman's side were hoping to celebrate with fans back on English soil but instead watched on as Brazil's exuberant supporters danced and sang at full-time.This is the beginning of a new cycle for the Lionesses and a time to experiment, but losing is not something Wiegman ever enjoys. \"When you go out on to the pitch you always want to win. Yes, it hurts, because that's the environment we're in. It's never nice to lose,\" she said. \"But at the same time, it's not the Euros or the World Cup. There are no consequences. You can take these opportunities to try out things.\"",
        "Among the things Wiegman tried out was a debut for goalkeeper Khiara Keating, who filled in for injured Euro 2025 star Hannah Hampton. It promised to be a special night for Keating, who ran out to a warm reception at the Etihad Stadium - home of her childhood club Manchester City, where she graduated from the academy and cemented her place in the first team. Dotted among the white shirts worn by England fans were some in the goalkeeper's green, bearing Keating's name on the back.But her dream debut was quickly tarnished as Brazil went 2-0 up within 18 minutes, putting England on the ropes - though Keating was not at fault. She recovered, putting in an assured performance as England pulled one goal back through Georgia Stanway but eventually had to settle for a 2-1 defeat.The scoreline did little to dampen Keating's spirits, who became the first black goalkeeper to represent the Lionesses.\"It felt like home and it was probably the best place for me to ever make [my debut],\" said Keating.\"I just think it's bonkers [I'm the first black female goalkeeper] and hopefully the gap for the next one isn't as big. \"Obviously times are changing now and football is going in the right direction, but I'm feeling dead proud.\"Keating's performance was enough to please Wiegman, who is already assessing her options for the 2027 Women's World Cup.\"She is a very talented player and has been with us a while. It was a hard start to the game but I think she dealt really well with it,\" said Wiegman. \"She didn't get many actions in the second half but it's even harder for a goalkeeper to be there at the moments when she's needed, so that was good. \"She stayed calm and played out [from the back] when the opportunities were there. I think we can be happy with her debut.\"",
        "The main point of discussion before the match was which position Manchester United captain Maya le Tissier should play in. Wiegman has made it clear she sees her as a right-back in the current England squad, despite Le Tissier playing her weekly football at centre-back for United. The talented 23-year-old has started 72 consecutive games at centre-back in the Women's Super League, and in her 104 appearances for United has only played one at right-back.Manchester United were keen to highlight this in a social media post last week, which sparked debate among supporters and thrust Wiegman's decision into question.But against Brazil, Le Tissier started in the full-back role and moved to the middle with just under 40 minutes remaining. \"I play week-in-week out at centre-half, so I feel much more comfortable at centre-half,\" she said afterwards.\"I have to think a bit more at right-back, but to be honest I'm just happy to play and get on the pitch. It's been frustrating for me.\"Wiegman highlighted Le Tissier's qualities, pointing out her pace and energy as valuable assets to the attacking full-back role she wants. The Dutchwoman stressed she knows what Le Tissier is capable of at centre-back but now was the time to try out new things. With Lucy Bronze guarding the position on a long-term basis, are there enough back-up options available or has Le Tissier become a victim of lack of squad depth?\"I think we have players but Lucy Bronze is still building her [fitness] and Niamh Charles is still building who can play there,\" Wiegman said.\"It's also what you need from the game. I definitely keep thinking Maya can play right-back and I know she can play centre-back too. \"It's about what the game is asking. This is the exact period to try. There are two years to go [until the World Cup] so I hope that we have many players that are going to challenge for that position.\"One of the potential back-ups is young Tottenham full-back Ella Morris, who previously received a senior call-up but sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training with England.But Le Tissier's showing at both right-back and centre-back in Saturday's defeat will have pleased Wiegman as she confirmed she was right at home in an England shirt.",

She has won seven league titles, three European crowns, nine Copas de la Reina and five Spanish Super Cups.While Barcelona were beaten by Arsenal in the Champions League final, and her remarkable return from a bout of viral meningitis shortly before the start of the Euros was not enough to guide Spain to the trophy, it was an impressive campaign.The creative playmaker netted the goal that beat Germany in the Euros semi-final as Spain made history by progressing to the final for the first time.She was also named the Champions League's player of the season by Uefa, registering nine goal contributions in her 11 appearances and scoring in their 4-1 semi-final second-leg win at Chelsea.Read Aitana Bonmati's full profile",

She regularly started ahead of Earps before her international retirement and has proved her worth for Sarina Wiegman's side.She saved two penalties in the victory over Spain in the final and did the same in their quarter-final success over Sweden.Her 13 clean sheets in the league for Chelsea also meant she shared the WSL golden glove with Manchester United's Phallon Tullis-Joyce.At the age of 24, she has already won the Women's Super League twice, the FA Cup and League Cup once, two European Championships and reached a World Cup final.Read Hannah Hampton's full profile",
