        "Jack Brown has made a big financial sacrifice to help England's bid to retain the Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup next year - but you will not hear him complaining about it.Nor will he grumble about having made England's job more difficult as they prepare for the forthcoming wheelchair Ashes series down under, because that is just how he wants it.\"We want to be playing the best, we want to be challenged and we want the sport to keep growing,\" he says.The Halifax Panthers player spent five and a half years living in Australia, coaching wheelchair rugby league while picking up lucrative work as a welder in the Queensland mines.The 35-year-old gave up the mining work and came home to West Yorkshire in April, rejoining the Panthers, because he wanted to play more regularly in the build-up to the World Cup.It has already paid off, with the Panthers winning the Wheelchair Super League Grand Final last month to add to the Challenge Cup and League Leaders' Shield, completing a treble.\"I knew I would take a hit coming back,\" he says. \"But back over here, there are other, more positive aspects of the lifestyle, with its connection with family and friends. You're a lot more around people.\"Brown - who scored two tries to help England beat France in a dramatic World Cup final in Manchester three years ago - is vice-captain for the four-match tour of Australia.England face New South Wales on Friday and Queensland next Monday before two Tests against Australia on 30 October and 2 November.During his time down under, Brown coached Queensland to four successive victories over New South Wales in the Wheelchair State of Origin match - now known as the Wheelchair State Challenge.He believes the standards of Australian wheelchair rugby league have risen over the past half-decade, and acknowledges that if England have a tough time of it down under, it will be partly down to his coaching.\"We like to be open, share everything with everyone,\" he says. \"We do it at club level, we do it at international level. If we can help someone, you help them whether it makes your job harder or not.\"",
        "Brown is one of two non-disabled players in England's squad for the Ashes tour; he first took up wheelchair basketball and then rugby league to share a sport on an equal level with his younger brother Harry, who lost both legs to meningitis as a baby.They were both part of the England team who won the Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup in 2008, and were runners-up in 2013 and 2017, before Harry concentrated on basketball, helping Great Britain to Paralympic silver in Paris last year.Wheelchair rugby league's international laws allow two of a team's five players on the court to be non-disabled, and Jack has become an England stalwart.But he was not playing regularly in Australia because of strict eligibility rules.\"I was training with a lot of the top players over in Australia, but in terms of representation, the eligibility rules are quite strict over there, so it kind of filters down,\" he said. \"If you're not eligible for Australia, you're not eligible for State of Origin, and it continues on down.\"It meant that throughout his time in Australia, Brown was only playing during trips home to England. And although he helped his country lift the World Cup in 2022, he did not feel it was going to work for 2026. Which meant a move home and giving up the lucrative welding.\"I was just doing a bit of workshop welding to start off with, but the aim was to try and get into the mines over there,\" he said.\"It had that team mentality around it, where you're going through really nasty periods of work and you're in some really bad places and some dirty places, and you've got to get through it together.\"It was a big decision to come back to England, because we had a lot of things over there and I've still got a lot of good, close friends over there.\"But I had to be realistic with myself. I was really lucky to be still alongside these players in the England side while I was over there and I think it was selfish of me to think that I could maintain that level with only playing one game a year.\"And for Brown, international success means more than money.\"I've set up a couple of businesses with close friends doing driving and maintenance, so I've got my finger in a couple of jars but that's not the important thing at the moment,\" he says.\"My only focus at the moment is just making sure I can get to every training on time, get to every game on time and the work will just take care of itself. I can always make more money.\"",

      "content": [
        "The story of how Luis Domingos switched from playing wheelchair basketball for Portugal to wheelchair rugby league for England is a complicated one. But it involves a business management degree in Huddersfield.Castleford Tigers' Domingos is one of two uncapped players in England's 10-man squad for the wheelchair rugby league Ashes. Tom Coyd's side will play four matches in late October and early November, including two Tests against Australia.It wasn't part of the 27-year-old's plan to make the Ashes squad when he returned to England after several years playing basketball professionally in Italy, Spain and Portugal. It just turned out that way.\"It was mainly because of family and wanting to achieve a goal of mine, which was to get a degree,\" he said.\"When you're doing a professional sport for so long, you get used to it and that becomes your normal. But I want to experience different things in life and getting a degree is one of the things I want to achieve. And I want to do it young, not after I finished my career.\"",
        "Born in Setubal, near Lisbon, of Angolan descent, Domingos is a wheelchair user as a result of a childhood bout of polio. He moved to Leeds with his family when he was 14 - \"I'm a Leeds United fan\" - and took up first wheelchair basketball with Leeds Spiders, for fun, and then rugby league with Leeds Rhinos, to improve his fitness.He was good enough at basketball to attract the attention of Portugal's co-captain Pedro Bartolo, who at the time was playing professionally in Italy's Serie A wheelchair basketball league with Varese. Domingos was invited to the northern Italian city, about 35 miles from Milan, for a trial.\"It was around 2019,\" he said. \"They invited me for two weeks' trial, but after three or four days, they said OK, just pack your stuff and come here. We like you.\"The offer of a professional contract came with a problem, though. Varese wanted Domingos straight away, but he was partway through studying for a healthcare qualification at Leeds City College. The solution? A chat with his friendly course leaders.\"I spoke to my college and they allowed me to do the course online,\" he said.\"It was too good an opportunity to turn down. For me it wasn't about the money - it was just about the opportunity to train every day.\"I went on my own. At the time, I didn't mind because I was going to live my dream. But as soon as I got there, I had a reality check. It was an expensive country. It was difficult to adapt from having my mum's food every day to having to cook every day, it was challenging. But it was an amazing experience.\"",
        "Domingos passed his healthcare course too - and over the next few years, spent time in Spain with second-tier Basketmi Ferrol and top-flight Servigest Burgos, then followed his friend and mentor Bartolo to Portugal to join BC Gaia, all the while racking up international appearances for the country of his birth.\"Spain's the biggest league in the world,\" Domingos said. \"It's the NBA of wheelchair basketball.\"I played alongside two of the best players: Mateusz Filipski - he's known as wheelchair basketball's Steph Curry. He can shoot from everywhere. He's a good leader, an amazing human. And I played alongside Lee Fryer, one of England's most exciting emerging players.\"But Domingos wanted to come back to England to study, starting a business management degree at the University of Huddersfield - he is set to graduate next summer.He kept up his fitness playing wheelchair basketball for a team in Wakefield, who shared training facilities with Wheelchair Championship rugby league side Castleford. A friend urged him to sign up with Cas - and everything has snowballed from there.In April, he scored the winning try as they beat North Wales Crusaders to win the Wheelchair Challenge Trophy, for second-tier clubs. In June, he was called into England's 17-strong national performance squad.And then in August, he made the final 10 to fly to Australia - qualifying for the call-up on residency grounds. His domestic season was capped last month when Castleford beat Rochdale in the Wheelchair Championship Grand Final.\"It feels amazing to be part of the Ashes,\" he said. \"England is a family. I feel privileged to be part of this.\"I think my experiences with Portugal will help me to deal with the pressure. I can take some of the things I've learned in professional settings to this.\"At the moment, I'm enjoying this. Everything happens for a reason and you know, if I try to understand the reason, it won't be so. Whatever happens tomorrow, I'm not sure. I'm hoping it's a good thing, but I'm living today.\"",

        "If Dan Pembroke isn't at the track, you will probably find him at his allotment.It is where the first seed of an idea grew into something far greater; an initial enjoyment of growing hops and dabbling with home brew kits has bloomed into an actual beer with his name on the can.In the lead-up to last year's Paralympics, Pembroke started brewing 'Paris Gold', as a physical representation of what he wanted and ultimately would go on to achieve in the French capital.Now Pembroke - a two-time Paralympic and world champion in the F13 javelin, for athletes with a visual impairment - has a new brew in the works that he hopes can have the same effect for his compatriots heading to the colder climates of the 2026 Winter Olympic and Paralympics in Italy.\"Two months before going to Paris, my new coach, John Trower, was talking about visualisation and manifestation, these things that he deemed very powerful in sport,\" Pembroke told BBC Sport.\"I'd never really dabbled with visualisation, so I thought, what way could I make this unique to myself? How could I manifest what I want out in Paris?\"I want to get the gold medal, I want it to be in Paris, and I want to hold up a beer to celebrate what I've done.\"After his success in Paris, Pembroke's home brewing caught the attention of a craft brewery, which has worked with the 34-year-old to produce it on a commercial scale.His new Milan beer will be an Italian pilsner using West Coast hops, as a nod to the next summer Games in Los Angeles.With plans for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions, he hopes to send batches to Italy for British athletes to enjoy after the Winter Games.\"I'm getting it out there and putting the message across about manifestation for them,\" Pembroke said.\"It's quite a wacky way to do it with beer and athletes, it's not something that normally goes together, but I think because of that it makes it stand out a little bit. And you've got to rock the boat a little bit sometimes to get eyes on you.\"",
        "Because for Pembroke - who has only 10% vision having been diagnosed with a degenerative eye condition, retinitis pigmentosa, when he was six - it's not just about beer.\"This is about me talking in front of crowds of people in conferences, in hospitality, about accessibility for people with invisible disabilities like myself,\" he said.\"I go into a restaurant or a bar and I often get asked 'do you have any dietary requirements?'. But never have I been asked 'do you have any accessibility requirements?'.\"Often I can't be accommodated for. I want to change that space for invisible disabilities, and in particular, visual impairments.\"",
        "Earlier in his athletics career, Pembroke was targeting the London 2012 Olympics before an elbow injury put paid to that dream.After a seven-year break and with his eyesight deteriorating, he came to Para-sport in 2019. Within two years he was Paralympic champion, throwing a Paralympic record of 69.52m in Tokyo.In Paris he reached new heights, breaking Uzbekistan's Aleksandr Svechnikov's seven-year world record with his third throw, before bettering that mark by more than three metres on his next effort with 74.49m to successfully defend his Paralympic crown.A year on from that golden achievement, Pembroke's next task is defending the global title he won in both 2023 and 2024 at the Para-athletics World Championships in New Delhi, which get under way on Saturday.As part of a 37-strong British contingent, external headed for India, he goes into the championships with \"my hunger back\", having struggled with the comedown from his Paralympic high.\"Paris was the pinnacle of my career so far,\" he said. \"It's weird to adjust coming back down the other side, because you need to reset your goals and your ambitions of where you want to go in the future.\"Those four months after Paris were very odd and strange for me. I was having ups and downs, but a big roller coaster of emotions, trying to adjust to what I'd done and where I'm going next.\"It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, it was pretty difficult.\"Sunshine is now on the horizon, however - Pembroke and his wife, Martina, will welcome their first baby in November.The prospect of having his child trackside at the LA Paralympics in three years' time is providing added motivation for Pembroke to continue his work both in and out of athletics.\"I'm not getting any younger, and I want to make the most of how my body's feeling at the moment,\" he said.\"I think I have the potential to break the [world] record and go more than 75m. Leading up to LA, that's what I wanted to achieve.\"But when I do finally retire, and I'm not sure when that is yet, I want to have a wholesome feeling that I've done something good, not just from throwing javelins far, but I want to try and change the space in society that deals with visual impairment.\"",

        "Nic Hamilton sat in his dark, messy apartment on the phone to Samaritans. It was his lowest point.In 2016 the racing driver was out of the sport and a recovering gambling addict.\"I didn't feel valuable,\" he told the BBC's Sport's Greatest Underdogs podcast.\"I wasn't racing and I wasn't getting sponsorship. My dad is a multi-millionaire, my brother is a multi-millionaire and they are going on this upward trajectory.\"I felt very lost and lonely and I just stumbled across gambling.\"Five stories from Britain's best sporting underdogsNic is the younger brother of a British sporting icon - Lewis Hamilton. The Formula 1 driver has won a joint-record seven world championships.The brothers were guided towards a career in motorsport from an early age, with the main focus on Lewis.\"The first category in motorsport when Lewis was a kid was 'cadet karts' for ages eight to 10,\" Nic recalled.\"We had a cheap third hand go-kart, we had no money and we were in a Vauxhall Cavalier. The go-kart was hanging out of the boot with my Mum [Linda Hamilton] holding onto it,\" he added.\"We had a gas heater and chicken noodle soup was all we could afford, we put everything into Lewis' racing.\"",
        "Hamilton has cerebral palsy, external - a group of lifelong conditions that affect movement and co-ordination and which is caused by a problem with the brain that develops before, during or soon after birth - so that makes his success as a racing driver even more remarkable. He currently competes in British Touring Cars with the Un-Limited Motorsport team, becoming the series' first disabled driver in 2015.The 33-year-old began his motorsport career in the Renault Clio Cup in 2011, cutting his teeth whizzing around UK circuits which included Silverstone, where brother Lewis has won a record nine times in F1.Nic said it was dad Anthony's idea for him to follow in his big brother's tyre marks.\"My dad was like 'maybe we should just give it a go and see',\" he said. \"With my cerebral palsy I'm really hyper-sensitive to noise like loud or sudden bangs, they make me jump.\"So when they used to start the engine up for Lewis it used to scare me.\"It was in a car park where Nic first got behind the wheel of a kart, despite his nerves.\"I remember the anxiety I felt inside but excitement as well. I was wearing all Lewis' race kit,\" he added.\"I ended up crashing that go-kart, I hit a kerb and I disappeared down a six-foot drop.\"The world of virtual racing gave Nic the experience and confidence to think about a career in the sport. It is a path followed by current F1 world champion Max Verstappen - the Dutchman has his own sim racing team.Nic got used to controlling karts and fell in love with driving at speed. In 2011, three years after Lewis had won his first F1 world championship, Nic made it to the Clio Cup grid. It was at one of the most famous circuits in Europe, Brands Hatch, in Kent.\"It was amazing, I qualified last, which I expected,\" he said. \"I was the only disabled person on the grid, everyone else was able-bodied.\"I was actually closer than I ever expected. I'd never driven at Brands Hatch before, never driven this car before.\"Lewis was there and I love him being there, but it's hard as it brings even more attention than I already have.\"In that first season, Nic finished 14th overall out of 27 competitors.",
        "Nic was a bona fide professional motorsport competitor, but not emulating his brother's incredible achievements on tracks around the globe.After a serious crash in testing for his third-ever race at Thruxton, he was knocked unconscious after his car \"catapulted\".\"I'm riddled with fear and in a very lonely place because I landed on my side and you never expect to be laying like that in a car,\" he said.\"The first thing I heard is a marshal saying 'Lewis isn't going to be impressed by that', straight away.\"It's the worst thing anyone could say at any moment in my life.\"That's the problem I've had being Lewis' brother, people really don't understand - they don't get it.\"They panic and don't know what to say to me and it can be the most disrespectful thing. I have to just take it on the chin.\"After that crash, Nic jumped back in the car the next day but his parents were concerned about him continuing in the sport.\"My mum was crying her eyes out and my dad shows fear through anger,\" Nic said. \"He was like 'I told you, don't make mistakes, don't crash'. Then the media picked it up, so it was the biggest thing.\"The only person who wasn't angry and understood it was Lewis, because he'd been there.\"Following another year in the Clio Cup series he moved to the European Touring Car Cup. While competing for the Baporo Motorsport team, he finished the championship in last place.",
