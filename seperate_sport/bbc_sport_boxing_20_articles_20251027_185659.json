        "Royston Barney-Smith said that he \"needed to step up to another gear\" for Saturday's win against Danny Quartermaine. \"Sugar Boy Roy\" outclassed his opponent at the O2 Arena on the way to a unanimous decision, claiming the WBO and IBF European super-featherweight belts.At 21, Barney-Smith remains unbeaten with 15 wins to his name.\"It's a big win and I'm really happy with the performance,\" he told BBC Sport.\"It meant a lot to me after an injury and some time out the gym this year, I just knew I had to step everything up to another gear and I did that.\"Every round I was hurting him so I just knew it was going to be a matter of time before I took him out, I knew I was capable of winning this fight and I did that but It was lingering on my mind.\" This fight was originally scheduled to take place earlier in the year on the south coast in Bournemouth. But Southampton's Barney-Smith had to pull out of the contest after suffering a knee injury weeks before the event. Throughout the contest he looked the superior operator, landing clean strikes as Quartermaine tried to make the bout awkward later on with erratic flurries forward.Southpaw Barney-Smith - who is trained by Ben Davison - hurt his opponent on a couple of occasions before dropping him in the 10th and final round with a sweet short right hand.Quartermaine was a fighter the young talent had suggested to promoter Frank Warren as someone he wanted to test himself against. \"I needed to have a breakthrough fight,\" Barney-Smith added.\"I've been screaming for one for the last year and I finally had my chance so I took it with both hands.\"I don't want to keep fighting journeymen who keep running away from me, I want to fight a live opponent and land some big shots and that is what I did tonight.\"",
        "As well as being promoted by Warren and Queensberry, the 73-year-old also serves as his manager.Before the contest, Warren described this fight as a \"big moment\" in Barney-Smith's career and teased that once he came through it there would be some exciting opportunities. \"British, European and Commonwealth, that's the direction he should be heading towards now,\" Warren told BBC Sport before the fight. \"We believe in Royston and we believe that this is the time for him, winning this fight will set him up for big things next year. \"He has the chance to get that momentum back that he previously had, and launch himself into 2026 to be fighting for big, big titles.\" Despite being twice scheduled to fight in Bournemouth, the Southampton fighter has not yet been able to do so after two injury pull-outs. He could still get the chance to fight there with talk of Queensberry planning a show with fellow Southampton boxer Ryan Garner early next year. Boxing could also return to his home town this summer with further talk that if Garner wins his next fight, he could headline a show at St Mary's Stadium.\"Honestly it would be a dream come true to fight on that card,\" Barney-Smith said.\"But before that I'd like to get out one more time before the end of the year but I will have to talk to Frank,\" he said.\"I just want to keep climbing the ladder now and pushing on for bigger and better things, I'm expecting a big 2026 with many more titles to come, stay tuned.\"",

      "content": [
        "Fabio Wardley pulled off a huge upset to wreck Joseph Parker's dreams of becoming a two-time world heavyweight champion and put himself in position for a shot at undisputed champion Oleksandr Usyk.The British fighter is now the number one challenger for the Ukrainian after he claimed a stunning comeback victory by stopping the veteran New Zealander in the 11th round of an entertaining and bruising battle at London's O2 Arena.Wardley, 30, claimed the WBO 'interim' title when he forced referee Howard Foster to stop the bout as he swarmed former world champion Parker, who had been hurt badly in the 10th by a right uppercut.The Ipswich native brought the crowd to their feet and collapsed to the floor in celebration as his corner team piled into the ring to celebrate.They were superb scenes as the former white-collar boxer continued his remarkable rise in the professional ranks.There was an argument that the stoppage was premature, especially given Parker had dominated for large parts of the fight and hurt Wardley numerous times with right hands.But the 33-year-old New Zealander offered little argument when Foster stepped in and his trainer Andy Lee did not appear to remonstrate as his man suffered his fourth career defeat.\"I said all the way through this build-up that we picked Joseph Parker because I believe I'm at the top and I proved I'm at the top,\" said Wardley.\"All credit to Joseph, he can't get enough respect and he deserves all the respect from the boxing community. He took a chance when he didn't have to, and we knew he wasn't going anywhere quickly. We had to pick our spots and eventually we got them out of there.\"It was a right uppercut from Wardley in the 10th round which swung the bout firmly back in favour of the underdog.This was Wardley's 20th career win and his most important. Usyk now potentially awaits early next year.Parker risked his position as the number one contender for Usyk's crown by taking this fight, falling to his fourth career defeat.Wardley's promoter Frank Warren told DAZN: \"Usyk said he wants to do it, so that's what it will be. It's a 36-minute fight and it only takes one second from him.\"",
        "It was a who's who of the British heavyweight scene in the arena with Tyson Fury, Daniel Dubois, Moses Itauma, Derek Chisora and Dillian Whyte among the onlookers.Usyk was not here, but he was the man this bout was all for.Wardley walked to the ring decked out in Ipswich Town colours with the football club's crest emblazoned on his kit.He spoke in the build-up how it was remarkable that when Parker was winning the WBO heavyweight title in 2016, he was only competing in white-collar boxing.Yet here he was on the same stage as the veteran Kiwi in a fight to determine the next challenger for Usyk, the greatest heavyweight of this era.With Lee in his corner, Parker was a red-hot run coming into this bout of six wins including victories over the likes of Zhilei Zhang, Deontay Wilder and Martin Bakole.As cries of 'Oh Fabio Wardley' rang around the arena, Parker established control with a ramrod of a jab that soon brought blood from the bridge of the Ipswich fighter's nose.The finish to the first three minutes was emphatic from the favourite as Parker powered through with a rocket of a right hand.",
        "Parker's control vanished when a right hand from Wardley rocked him in the second. It would be a precursor to what would follow later in the fight. It was a beautiful shot and brought those ringside to their feet as the New Zealander looked unsteady on his.The experience of Parker, in his 40th professional fight, looked like it was going to be crucial here. Wardley was always dangerous, but Parker was landing the better shots through the middle rounds.The Kiwi's left uppercuts to the body and right hands over the top were a particular highlight, but Wardley's own backhand remained a threat. The fight appeared to be fizzling out in the eighth before it burst back into life and swung firmly back in Wardley's favour in the 10th.He ensured his stunning story would get another chapter against Usyk when he swarmed Parker in the 11th with a barrage of shots which forced Foster to step in.It may have been early but Wardley will argue that Parker was taking significant punishment.",
        "Usyk sought a medical exemption to delay his mandatory defence of the WBO title because of a back injury, but his advisor Serge Lapin recently confirmed the unbeaten champion was ready to face the winner of this bout.Warren will now look to make that fight next year for his man.With just 21 professional fights on the back of no amateur background having come from the white-collar scene, Wardley is still raw and his ascent to this position has been considerably fast tracked.But now he is in a position to take on the best heavyweight of this era and cap a Hollywood-like tale.Parker will have to carefully consider his next step, given his age and how long he has been competing at the top level. He took a huge gamble here and his chances of regaining a piece of the world heavyweight crown have been diminished.",

        "With just 21 professional fights on the back of no amateur background having come from the white-collar scene, Wardley is still raw and his ascent to this position has been considerably fast tracked.",
        "But now he is in a position to take on the best heavyweight of this era and cap a Hollywood-like tale.",
        "Parker will have to carefully consider his next step, given his age and how long he has been competing at the top level.",
        "He took a huge gamble here and his chances of regaining a piece of the world heavyweight crown have been diminished.",

        "Joseph Parker warned Briton Fabio Wardley about \"levels\" as he vowed to \"smash him\" in Saturday's heavyweight battle at London's O2 Arena.The contest for Parker's WBO 'interim' belt is billed as 'All or Nothing', with the winner expected to face undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk next.And the New Zealander, 33, is confident he will end Wardley's 20-fight unbeaten record.\"I've got many miles on the clock and I've got many more to bring,\" said former world champion Parker at Thursday's news conference.\"I'm only getting into my prime now. Credit to Wardley for taking this fight, but it's the wrong time to be taking this fight because I'm going to smash him.\"",
        "Parker is currently the WBO's number one contender and next in line to face Ukrainian Usyk, but has agreed to take on the 30-year-old Wardley, risking his mandatory position in pursuit of another statement success.The Auckland-born fighter has lost three of his 39 professional bouts - to Britons Anthony Joshua, Dillian Whyte and Joe Joyce - but appears revitalised under trainer Andy Lee.Recent wins over Deontay Wilder, Zhilei Zhang and Martin Bakole have re-established Parker among the heavyweight division's elite.\"I'm a different level, to be honest, and I'll show it on Saturday,\" added Parker, who held the full WBO world title between 2016 and 2018.Asked to explain what he meant by \"levels\", he said: \"You'll see. I don't want to explain with words, I'll explain with actions on Saturday night.\"",
        "Ipswich fighter Wardley's rise through the heavyweight ranks has been nothing short of remarkable.Having only taken up boxing aged 20, he began in the unlicensed white-collar scene before turning professional.In response to Parker's comments, Wardley remained unfazed.\"For me it's nothing new. I relish the challenge,\" he added. \"I look forward to stepping up. Proving people wrong, proving doubters wrong, and that I belong very much at this top level.\"Having shown his quality at domestic level with notable victories over David Adeleye and Frazer Clarke, Wardley produced a stunning one-punch 10th-round knockout of Australian Justis Huni in June - despite trailing on the scorecards at the time.But he believes his knockout record - 18 of them in 19 wins and one draw - sometimes overshadows his technical ability.\"Just because my record is littered with highlight-reel knockouts, I think people get distracted by that and take away my actual boxing skills which set up those punches or brought me to those moments,\" said Wardley.\"If you think I'll be running around that ring with my right hand ready to go, then there's a lot more you and the team will need to prepare for.\"As the news conference drew to a close, Parker repeated his earlier statement when asked for a final message for Wardley. \"I'm going to smash you,\" he added, although there was little real animosity between the pair despite the fiery words as they ended the obligatory face-off with smiles and a handshake.",

      "topic": "'The saint of Manchester' - Ricky Hatton and his city, a love story",
      "content": [
        "It is the Thursday after Ricky Hatton died and the Cheshire Cheese pub in Gee Cross, one of the boxer's locals, is serving up drinks as regulars chat away. Normal life goes on, just as Hatton would have wanted it to.Just a short walk around the corner is The Heartbreak - not a pub, but the gated property fit for a champion that was Hatton's home. It was named by Hatton after Elvis Presley's chart-topping Heartbreak Hotel.Fans and friends come and go, leaving flowers and tributes. There are Manchester City shirts, boxing gloves, the odd can of Guinness, Only Fools and Horses memorabilia - Hatton was a huge fan and owned a three-wheeled van - and more tokens of appreciation.Two mourners who have stopped off to leave a tribute are Trev and his wife, Sue. Trev grew up in Gloucester but moved to this part of the world when Hatton was in his pomp.He would regularly see 'The Hitman' in some of the local pubs after his retirement and recalls how Hatton helped to raise funds for a charity which was supporting Sue's late son, who had cancer.\"I wasn't from here, but he showed me what it takes to be a Mancunian,\" said Trev.\"He should be known as the saint of Manchester.\"Hatton was a hero far beyond where he grew up, even if the fact he stayed so true to his roots is why so many loved him.Brought up on a Hattersley council estate, he was still based nearby until his tragically early death at just 46.The two-weight world champion, who many believe is Manchester's greatest ever fighter, was someone who put his city's name up in lights in the boxing world.Hatton was a figurehead for Hyde and Tameside who became a national and international superstar.They are among the many reasons thousands lined the streets of Greater Manchester to honour the life and say goodbye to Richard John Hatton - an icon of the north-west.From the Cheshire Cheese to Manchester Cathedral, where his funeral took place, fans of Hatton the fighter and Hatton the man took their place on the route for his final journey.",
        "The late Paul Dunne was coaching at Sale West ABC in the 1990s when he walked into the Lively Lobster pub in Ashton upon Mersey one Friday night and proudly declared a future world champion had walked into his boxing club.Hatton had just recently moved to Sale West, but he had begun boxing closer to home in Hyde, at the Louvolite Gym – now Hyde and District ABC - under the guidance of the late Ted Peake.Boxing reporter Steve Lillis remembers evenings at The Junction Inn in Ashton-under-Lyne. A Hatton relative was running the pub so his name was regularly mentioned as he progressed in the amateur code.Lillis, along with now BBC 5 Live boxing voice Steve Bunce, would travel to Birmingham to watch Hatton win the ABA title in 1997.\"It was like a spaceship taking off into orbit,\" said Lillis, who covered almost every one of Hatton's professional fights.\"From that moment on, we knew we were on an incredible journey.\"But Hatton wasn't always a big draw.\"He had his first fight in Widnes and he sold three or four tickets,\" said Frank Warren, the promoter who guided Hatton all the way from turning professional to the IBF light-welterweight title.Paul Speak was Hatton's long-time manager, close friend and dealt with his media engagements.\"When Rick was boxing, there was no social media so you couldn't build yourself that way,\" said Speak.\"It was word of mouth.

Unforgettable nights with Marcos Maidana, Zab Judah and Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez.And then, years later, reality TV infamy with his own BBC documentary - not forgetting his role in I'm a Celebrity's \"strawberry-gate\".Now the former champion has swapped fight nights and jungle antics for a new adventure.On Wednesday, Khan will bring top-tier professional boxing to Nigeria for the first time on the country's Independence Day, when the streets of Lagos will be alive with parades, music and national pride.\"You can imagine all the hype. Everyone will have a day off and will want to come,\" Khan tells BBC Sport from his home in Dubai.The event, called Chaos in the Ring, is being promoted by Khan's AK Promotions in partnership with African-based Balmoral Group Promotions.It follows his debut card in Ghana earlier this year, but Khan believes Lagos will be even bigger.\"I'm still new to the game but I want to learn quick and move quick,\" he says. \"Why Africa?

I'm happy to roll the dice because I want to learn the trade as I go,\" he says.For now, his plan is to grow the sport in Africa and the Middle East, before breaking back into the UK market when the timing is right. He also dreams of staging fights in Saudi Arabia as part of the lucrative Riyadh Season.But to do that, he knows he needs support. Khan is calling on broadcasters, co-promoters and former allies to show him the same loyalty he once gave them. \"I made them millions, let's see if they do the same for me now,\" he adds.",

      "content": [
        "New sport aged 35. World title within eight fights. The first UFC fighter to win a boxing world title. Headline at Goodison Park.For Molly 'Meatball' McCann, all the above is on her hit list. On Saturday she steps into the boxing ring for the first time as a professional, six months after she retired from MMA and 16 years after she last boxed.McCann was a promising amateur before switching to MMA, winning an ABA title.The odds are stacked against McCann but she is used to that. Her naysayers were often louder than her supporters during her UFC career.\"Since I was a little girl, my dream was to be a world champion in boxing,\" she says.\"I'm not here to believe people can put down my dreams and ambitions and what I want to be.\"I kind of let that happen in the MMA world and now it's time to take back who little Molly was and why she started fighting.\"McCann's training base is at No Limits Boxing Gym in Liverpool. Her interview with BBC Sport takes place moments after a session, in a little room upstairs with a shower in the corner.As it gets started, McCann leaves for a moment to ask the gym floor to keep the noise down. They oblige.Despite never reaching the very top of the UFC title mountain, McCann retired as the most famous female MMA fighter the UK has ever produced.With performance and sponsorship bonuses included, she earned upwards of £50,000 for her last UFC fights.While women's boxing has boomed in the last five years, MMA was one of the few places female athletes could earn as much as their male counterparts.Some might think money is the motivation for McCann's latest move.Ex-UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou earned millions more than his best UFC pay day when he crossed into boxing in 2023.But for McCann, that is not the case.\"That's not the reason. I'm sure the money will come,\" McCann says.\"I don't think people should be in combat sport just to make money.\"I think it's very dangerous. I'm taking a big cut to come to boxing because I wanted to do it and I love it.\"",
        "McCann was lounging by the pool in Florence not long after her last UFC fight when her phone rang. \"You're not done,\" her manager said at the other end.A move to boxing was something McCann had planned for years but she had to convince those around her.She knew her mother didn't want to her to fight any more. McCann decided before she retired from MMA to join Eddie Hearn's ranks and when the deal was done, she broke the news to her mum.\"'I've signed a 10-fight deal with Matchroom and Eddie Hearn, bye'. Put the phone down. She kept ringing me back and I wouldn't answer the phone,\" McCann says, laughing.The rest of her family were easier. McCann's grandmother, who hasn't attended a fight since 2018, is even considering ending her self-imposed ringside exile.McCann retired from MMA off the back of two defeats. \"Not good enough any more,\" she says as to why.No MMA fighter since the rise of the UFC has been able to cross over and become a boxing world champion. There are fighters who went in the opposite direction, like multiple-weight boxing world champion Holly Holm, who spectacularly dethroned UFC champion Ronda Rousey.It is a testament to how different the disciplines are. As Ngannou found out, you need far more than a knockout punch to be successful in boxing.McCann says range has been the hardest adjustment but there is also getting the MMA patterns out of her mind.There are no kicks or takedowns to worry about but the stance is different and working off a consistent jab is a challenge for every MMA fighter.In training, McCann has sometimes felt the urge to lift the knee to block an incoming opponent - \"muscle memory\", as she puts it.\"I've got to stay strong on that. Because if I get disqualified it's my own fault,\" she adds.\"I'm choosing not to do influencer boxing and do proper, pure boxing for a reason, to show the sport some respect.\"",
        "McCann has sought advice from various pros. Retired world champion Tony Bellew has been a constant source of encouragement.She is confident her MMA career puts her in a better position to succeed now than if she had she stuck with boxing when she was 19. McCann wants to be a mix of all her favourite fighters – Natasha Jonas, Miguel Cotto, Roy Jones Jr, Jane Couch, Arturo Gatti, Katie Taylor and Ricky Hatton.She describes the boxing version of herself as \"Molly McCann on Red Bull\".Having recently built a media wall in her home, there are six holes which could potentially fit belts. Her Cage Warriors flyweight title currently sits in one.McCann's goal is to be world champion within eight fights. It's not impossible. Nina Hughes won her bantamweight world title in four fights, Claressa Shields had three middleweight world titles in seven bouts.Aiming to fight in and around 8st 10lb, McCann could find herself in the ring against super-bantamweight Ellie Scotney or bantamweight Cherneka Johnson in the future.Nothing, however, seems to faze 'Meatball', who has Goodison Park in her sights for 2026.\"I don't want to retire not feeling fulfilled,\" McCann says.\"All the goals I wrote out as a kid that I wanted to achieve, this is the last one on there.\"I haven't got the luxury of time to fall back on.

      "content": [
        "\"I can definitely do that.\"Tiah-Mai Ayton, 19, has set her sights on becoming the youngest ever undisputed champion in the four-belt era across both genders in boxing.America's Gabriela Fundora was just 22 when she held all the world titles in the flyweight division in November 2024.Ayton clearly isn't shy when laying out her ambitions, but why should she? In over 300 fights across Muay Thai, mixed martial arts, kickboxing, jiu-jitsu and boxing, just three of those have been defeats - which she later avenged.She will contest her second professional boxing bout against Lydie Bialic on Saturday.When the Bristol fighter was told about Fundora's achievement, her eyes lit up: \"I could do that. I can definitely do that. \"That's going to be a new challenge for me. I've got a long time.\"Ayton is right. She does have a long time, but women's boxing also moves fast - just look at compatriot Nina Hughes. She won a world title in just her fifth fight as a professional. Not only is Ayton setting her sights on records, but she's got her eyes on gold and plenty of it.\"I want to be undisputed in bantamweight and super-bantamweight and then it goes featherweight and super-featherweight,\" said Ayton.\"I want to do those four categories, and I want to be undisputed in all four. It's high expectations but I think I can do it.\"Only one boxer, Claressa Shields, has won all four world titles in three different weights, no one yet has managed it in four.The likes of Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano have paved the way for women boxers to earn millions of pounds but Ayton isn't getting carried away despite her youth.When asked what she would purchase with her first healthy fight purse, the teenager opted against a flash car.\"I want a farm. I want cows, sheep, goats and chickens. That's my dream,\" Ayton said.\"I'll just live a quiet life on my farm and then when I train, I'll go into camp, and then go back and be peaceful.\"",
        "Ayton signed with promoter Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing after she caught the eye when sparring with former featherweight world champion Skye Nicolson aged 18.At youth level, she is a five-time national champion and won gold in the 57kg weight category at the amateur World Championships in Colorado last year.She also won the televised Haringey Box Cup in June last year at the 60kg lightweight limit.This was all before a stunning stoppage in the third round of her professional debut against Sara Orszagi in June.But, despite the super-bantamweight wanting to make history in the sport, if it wasn't for childhood squabbles with her sister, she might not have discovered her talent at all.\"It's actually so silly,\" Ayton said.\"I started because me and my sister always used to fight all the time. \"My dad got us into kickboxing at the age of six, and I just carried it on from there. I've always known I'd be a fighter.\"",
        "Ayton was earmarked as a potential prospect for Great Britain's Olympic Games team because of her impressive youth career.She said \"everyone wants a gold medal\" - but the style of amateur boxing put her off.\"I had the opportunity to go with GB but I'm a family person and I love being with my family. I didn't want to move away and move up to Sheffield,\" she said.\"I feel like the whole style of amateur just didn't suit me. I just like getting in there and fighting. \"I like stopping people.\"The decision was made to turn pro at the tender age of 18 and in May, she was signed by Matchroom.Being signed by Hearn and boasting a 21-0 amateur record mean Ayton carries a huge reputation with her into her debut.With braces on her teeth and being touted as the future of women's boxing, Ayton felt the pressure.\"I remember having a chat with my coach [Dean Lewis] before. We both had pressure on us,\" she said.\"Everyone has bigged me up and when people lose, they blame it on their coaches, so we had a lot of pressure on us. \"I know what I'm capable of and he knows what I'm capable of. \"It's just another day for me really. I've been fighting since I can remember. It's just about winning, that's all I care about.\"",

        "IBF welterweight world title: Lewis Crocker v Paddy DonovanVenue: Windsor Park, Belfast Date: Saturday, 13 SeptemberCoverage: Live on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra 2, with live text commentary on BBC Sport website and app",
        "The late, great Emanuel Steward once said, \"I've never had a fighter that I've rated higher,\" when speaking of an up-and-coming Andy Lee.A prophecy that the 21-year-old who had arrived at Steward's Kronk gym in Detroit would go on to win world honours came to pass when Lee stopped Matt Korobov for the WBO middleweight title in 2014 - two years after his venerable trainer's passing.In some ways, there are parallels to Steward's mentoring of Lee and the role that the Limerick native, 41, has with Paddy Donovan who will take on Lewis Crocker for the vacant IBF welterweight title at Belfast's Windsor Park on Saturday night.Lee, a second cousin of Tyson Fury, has been a part of the coaching team for the 'Gypsy King' on some of the big nights against Deontay Wilder and Oleksandr Usyk, but on Saturday, he plans to be celebrating his first world champion.Following his retirement as a prizefighter, a move to coaching was not quite inevitable, but a glimpse of the then amateur Donovan convinced him to guide the fortunes of his fellow Limerick man and member of the Irish Travellers community whom he felt had the X-factor that Steward once saw in him.\"We sat in 2019 and I could see the potential right away,\" Lee said of 'The Real Deal' who lost his first fight with Crocker in March by way of disqualification for punching after the bell when ahead on all three cards.\"It'll be nice to have Paddy, the first one I started with, becoming the first one to do it (win a world title). Not that I expected it this way, but it's good. A Limerick man and a Traveller like myself, so it's great.\"For young Travellers out there and those from disadvantaged backgrounds, if you can come from where we came from and become world champions in this sport, you can do it anywhere.\"",
        "Once upon a time, Lee was the young hopeful, fresh from the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens where he was Ireland's sole boxing representative.Until that point, his journey had taken him from London, where he began at the famed Repton club, to St Francis Boxing Club in Limerick when his family opted to relocate back to Castleconnell when he was aged 14.Following the Athens Games, Lee had caught the attention of Steward who signed the tall southpaw to ensure Detroit was his next destination.Keen to make an early impression, Lee famously arrived straight off the flight across the Atlantic and requested the opportunity to spar. Initially reluctant, Steward acceded to his wish and watched the newcomer, wearing borrowed boots and gloves, more than held his own against an established star in Cornelius Bundrage. Thus began a relationship that was deeper than coach and fighter - an approach Lee employs with his own fighters which include Donovan, heavyweight Joseph Parker, Hamzah Sheeraz and Ben Whittaker.\"The influence of Emanuel, outside of my parents, is probably the biggest in my life because I lived with him all those years. He cooked my food and did my laundry,\" Lee recalled.\"Emanuel grew me for that level from the start of my career. I travelled with him doing HBO [commentary in the United States], watched the fights and was in camp with [Wladimir] Klitschko, Jermain Taylor and all of the big fighters.\"Emanuel built a lot of confidence in his fighters. If he praised you, you were over the moon. I try to do the same with these fighters and get to know them as people, find out what makes them tick. You have such intimate relationships with each of them as you train.\"",
        "Just as Lee trained and sometimes sparred heavyweight king Klitschko, Donovan spent his first camp in the company of Fury, learning the tricks of the trade inside and outside of the ropes which have prepared him for his big night on Saturday.In boxing, as in life, there are ups and downs with Lee losing his first world title opportunity when stopped by Julio Chavez Jr in 2012, just months before his great mentor succumbed to colon cancer.It was under the tutelage of Adam Booth that Lee scaled the mountain with a highlight-reel knockout of John Jackson preceding the title win against Korobov.As much as the methods and lessons of Steward have moulded him as a coach, so too have those learnt under Booth and the coaches who guided him as an amateur.\"When I look back at my life, being with fantastic coaches like Nicholas Cruz Hernandez, Zaur Antia, Billy Walsh, Gary Keegan, then Emanuel, SugarHill [Steward], Joey Gamache, Adam Booth to finish my career - you pick up so much,\" he acknowledged.\"I still do the training with these guys that I did with Adam, all the physical circuits.\"That stable has been growing in number and stature with Lee helping heavyweight Parker get his career back on track with some eye-catching wins against Wilder and Zhilei Zhang, while Sheeraz and Whittaker have sought out his services to get them to the summit.The Ballybrack Boxing Club in Dublin is a positive environment as the wins keep building, and Lee is confident Donovan can lead the way with the first world title for his team.\"I just look at him now and see a world champion.\"The great fighters have an aura about them, how they carry themselves, and I can see that in Paddy.

        "With her left eye swollen shut and blood pouring from her forehead, Heather Hardy tells the ringside doctor that she wants to continue.She strides back to the centre of the ring, beats her chest and shouts \"I don't care, I don't care.\"A near 20,000-strong crowd at American Airlines Center in Texas rises to its feet and lets out a huge roar of appreciation in admiration for a true warrior.It is gladiatorial – it is all Hardy knows.Hardy, 42, has never been a quitter and is not going to change the habit of a lifetime in the final minutes of her bout against undisputed featherweight champion Amanda Serrano.They meet in the middle, touch gloves and the frantic action resumes – throwing heavy shots for the last 15 seconds of the penultimate round – before Hardy returns to her corner and once again hits her chest while soaking up the atmosphere.One final round of all-out action follows until the bell rings and the two fighters share an embrace.The blood is still being wiped from Hardy’s face as ring announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr prepares to confirm the result.Serrano wins by a sweeping unanimous decision. There is no shock, surprise or protest from Hardy.Serrano landed almost twice as many blows, and it goes down as another trademark gutsy performance from Brooklyn-born Hardy.",
        "That contest on 5 August 2023 would ultimately prove to be Hardy's final trip to the ring in a competitive capacity.\"I came out of the ring, got home and I had double vision,\" Hardy tells BBC Sport.\"I also had regular concussion stuff, normal fighter stuff but the next day the double vision didn't go away and I was kind of walking into stuff and I didn't feel right.\"Long story short, it didn't get any better, but I just got used to it. It's like anything else if you break something or bruise something you just train through it.\"A year on from that defeat, rather than enjoying the fruits of a long career, Hardy is instead grappling with her utility company, Con Edison, on the phone.\"My lights are getting ready to get shut off. I bet you [two-time welterweight champion] Shawn Porter doesn't have that problem,\" Hardy says.Hardy and Porter are both former world champions and appeared on the same card in 2016 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn but that is where the comparisons end.Financially they are worlds apart.\"I had this beautiful career but it's like they just pushed me back outside the fence and said 'just be happy you had the chance Heather, it was nice but go figure it out yourself', \" Hardy says.",
        "On 6 May 2024 Hardy posted a statement on Instagram confirming that her Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC) debut against flyweight champion Christine Ferea, which was scheduled to take place five days later, was off.Former WBO featherweight champion Hardy has never been one to bite her tongue but there was a reluctance, a refusal, an unwillingness to say the word retirement.Instead, Hardy signed off the post: \"So I said the thing, ya know what that means.\"And it is clear what she meant.In the months that followed after losing against Serrano, Hardy had lost almost 30lb in weight, was dealing with persistent headaches and was unable to sleep - all symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).CTE is a brain condition linked to repeated blows to the head and concussion. The condition, which gradually gets worse over time and leads to dementia, can only be diagnosed post-mortem.\"What I learned after was that every time you get a concussion a piece of your brain dies and you never get it back, your brain just goes on living without it because it doesn't know what it lost,\" Hardy says.\"Over the years I've lost so much of my brain that I can't afford to lose anything else.\"The external scars have long since healed but internally they linger and may never disappear.Just a few months on from announcing her retirement, Hardy is still coming to terms with having the rug snatched from underneath her.\"That was days of crying, trying to understand, because everything I ever did was to the max and now I have to quit when it gets hard to save my life, \" Hardy says.\"Wow, not fair. Give that to someone else.\"",
        "Hardy cuts a dejected figure as she speaks.Sitting at her kitchen table in her one-bedroom apartment with boxing equipment piled up in the background and wearing heart-shaped glasses, Hardy attempts to make light of her situation.\"I can't complain, I'm hanging in there and on the right side of the dirt,\" she says.Boxing became Hardy's identity and Gleason's gym in Brooklyn became her home. She has poured her heart and soul into the sport, but what has she received in return? What does she have to show for more than a decade of blood, sweat and tears?\"The last two months for me has been bouncing back and learning to live like this,\" Hardy says.She can no longer hit the gym on a daily basis, as she has done for the best part of two decades, and has been warned by medical professionals that any further physical stress on her body could have serious consequences.The lightest of workouts now makes Hardy feel nauseous – she recalls passing out when her heart rate went up after trying to jump rope.Headaches are regular, her eyesight is still yet to return to normal, she struggles to sleep and rarely has an appetite.Hardy would often coach at Gleason’s gym to earn some extra money, but her declining health has even taken that option off the table.\"I said 'stupid, you're not in a wheelchair'. It's a hybrid feeling of high-five you made it out but I still gave everything and I have nothing, \" Hardy says.\"What is hard for me to grip is that I gave so much and now I have to start over again.\"",
        "Hardy's route into boxing was far removed from the traditional path.She had already graduated from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York with a degree in forensic psychology and idolised the late Supreme Court justice and women's rights pioneer Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she even conceived the idea of a career in boxing.Hardy knew she was a \"powerful woman\" but was unsure how to put her powers to best use.Trying to make ends meet as a single mum and working anywhere between two to six jobs at one time, Hardy first stepped into a boxing gym in 2010 as a way to get a break from the daily grind. It soon became a passion and potentially a way out as she strived to provide a better quality of life for her daughter.In April 2011, Hardy, aged 29, competed in her first amateur contest and became the US national featherweight champion just two months later.After making her professional debut in the summer of 2012, Hardy embarked on a six-year unbeaten run, spanning 23 contests and culminating in a victory against Shelly Vincent for the WBO featherweight title at the Theater, inside Madison Square Garden.She also challenged herself in the world of mixed martial arts and competed four times under the banner of promotion Bellator - winning two and losing two.A first defeat in the boxing ring came at the hands of Serrano, a seven-division world champion, when they first met in 2019 and she retired with an overall record of 24 wins, three losses and one no-contest.Hardy achieved that success inside the ring despite facing challenges few could ever imagine or would wish to experience in her personal life.\"There was everything from hurricanes to homelessness and house fires,\" she says.\"We were on the street with my parents living in a church basement, anything that could happen did happen.\"But I'm sitting here because I have faith in God and I've walked with him this entire path. It's a simple idea that you walk right, you do right and you don't look back. You don't give up, you don't stop and what you deserve will come.\"",
        "Hardy has long been one of the loudest voices in the room when it comes to highlighting gender inequality and pay disparity in the sport.Despite her profile, Hardy still had to sell her own tickets to ensure she came out of fights with some financial reward.\"Women are making 80 cents to the dollar, the pay gap in female sports is absurd,\" Hardy says.\"This is something that women are constantly fighting for, constantly improving and look how far we've come in 10 years from when my career started and girls were not allowed to box on Showtime.\"The guys would say 'Heather I love you but I'm not putting you on, you're crazy'. Ten years ago, you'd think it was 1974. It will change because of women like me who won't shut up.\"There has undoubtedly been a change in the landscape with female boxers getting more prominent positions on cards and pay-per-view events, although Hardy believes there has not been an improvement in pay to back it up.\"Females are being put in prime spots on prime cards and told they aren't selling fights,\" Hardy says.\"They are being put in the best spot on the show and being paid a fraction of what that spot is worth.\"I went out and tried to tell people 'look, women can fight' but what I really did was say 'look guys women will work for nothing and we'll do it twice as hard'.\"",
        "With a family of strong women behind her, it is no surprise that Hardy has taken it upon herself to be a leading figure in the fight for equality.Hardy says her great grandmother, Annie, was one of the first female firefighters in the US and her grandmother was the first woman to teach gym in Brooklyn.\"We always joke that if my grandmother heard me tell people I was Irish she would slap me because my grandfather's family were from Ireland but she was from Scotland,\" Hardy says.She credits her mother, also a volunteer in the fire department, for helping shape her.\"My real father tried to kill us, went to jail and my mum took me and married John Hardy who is my daddy,\" she says.\"A very strong woman came from the ashes so I learned. It's in my blood. We don't look back, we will walk through fire. I am my mother's savage daughter.\"",
        "With one door closed, Hardy is already looking to force open the next one, getting her manager’s licence.As Hardy begins to reflect on what has been a trailblazing career in combat sports, her eyes light up when asked to pick a highlight.\"I'm from New York City and Billy Joel is you know,\" she says. \"I'm a poor Irish girl and we sang so many Billy Joel songs. We all go and see him every year when he plays at the Garden, honestly for 20 years or so.\"When I made my MMA debut and I knocked out the girl [Alice Yauger] I had fallen on my knees at one point and I was listening to everyone shout 'Hardy, Hardy, Hardy' and I looked up and thought 'Billy Joel sits here and they are singing my name'.\"I never let go of that.\"",

        "She had already graduated from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York with a degree in forensic psychology and idolised the late Supreme Court justice and women's rights pioneer Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she even conceived the idea of a career in boxing.",
        "Hardy knew she was a \"powerful woman\" but was unsure how to put her powers to best use.",
        "Trying to make ends meet as a single mum and working anywhere between two to six jobs at one time, Hardy first stepped into a boxing gym in 2010 as a way to get a break from the daily grind. It soon became a passion and potentially a way out as she strived to provide a better quality of life for her daughter.",
        "In April 2011, Hardy, aged 29, competed in her first amateur contest and became the US national featherweight champion just two months later.",
        "After making her professional debut in the summer of 2012, Hardy embarked on a six-year unbeaten run, spanning 23 contests and culminating in a victory against Shelly Vincent for the WBO featherweight title at the Theater, inside Madison Square Garden.",
        "She also challenged herself in the world of mixed martial arts and competed four times under the banner of promotion Bellator - winning two and losing two.",
        "A first defeat in the boxing ring came at the hands of Serrano, a seven-division world champion, when they first met in 2019 and she retired with an overall record of 24 wins, three losses and one no-contest.",
        "Hardy achieved that success inside the ring despite facing challenges few could ever imagine or would wish to experience in her personal life.",
        "\"There was everything from hurricanes to homelessness and house fires,\" she says.",
        "\"We were on the street with my parents living in a church basement, anything that could happen did happen.",
        "\"But I'm sitting here because I have faith in God and I've walked with him this entire path. It's a simple idea that you walk right, you do right and you don't look back. You don't give up, you don't stop and what you deserve will come.\"",
        "Heather Hardy was hoping to represent the USA at the 2012 Olympics",
        "Hardy has long been one of the loudest voices in the room when it comes to highlighting gender inequality and pay disparity in the sport.",
        "Despite her profile, Hardy still had to sell her own tickets to ensure she came out of fights with some financial reward.",
        "\"Women are making 80 cents to the dollar, the pay gap in female sports is absurd,\" Hardy says.",
        "\"This is something that women are constantly fighting for, constantly improving and look how far we've come in 10 years from when my career started and girls were not allowed to box on Showtime.",
        "\"The guys would say 'Heather I love you but I'm not putting you on, you're crazy'. Ten years ago, you'd think it was 1974. It will change because of women like me who won't shut up.\"",
        "There has undoubtedly been a change in the landscape with female boxers getting more prominent positions on cards and pay-per-view events, although Hardy believes there has not been an improvement in pay to back it up.",
        "\"Females are being put in prime spots on prime cards and told they aren't selling fights,\" Hardy says.",
        "\"They are being put in the best spot on the show and being paid a fraction of what that spot is worth.",
        "\"I went out and tried to tell people 'look, women can fight' but what I really did was say 'look guys women will work for nothing and we'll do it twice as hard'.\"",
        "Heather Hardy fought at Madison Square Garden in New York on four occasions",
        "With a family of strong women behind her, it is no surprise that Hardy has taken it upon herself to be a leading figure in the fight for equality.",
        "Hardy says her great grandmother, Annie, was one of the first female firefighters in the US and her grandmother was the first woman to teach gym in Brooklyn.",
        "\"We always joke that if my grandmother heard me tell people I was Irish she would slap me because my grandfather's family were from Ireland but she was from Scotland,\" Hardy says.",
        "She credits her mother, also a volunteer in the fire department, for helping shape her.",
        "\"My real father tried to kill us, went to jail and my mum took me and married John Hardy who is my daddy,\" she says.",
        "\"A very strong woman came from the ashes so I learned. It's in my blood. We don't look back, we will walk through fire. I am my mother's savage daughter.\"",
        "For the past decade Heather Hardy has been part the 'Give a Kid a Dream' charity at Gleason's gym",
        "With one door closed, Hardy is already looking to force open the next one, getting her manager’s licence.",
        "As Hardy begins to reflect on what has been a trailblazing career in combat sports, her eyes light up when asked to pick a highlight.",
        "\"I'm from New York City and Billy Joel is you know,\" she says. \"I'm a poor Irish girl and we sang so many Billy Joel songs. We all go and see him every year when he plays at the Garden, honestly for 20 years or so.",
        "\"When I made my MMA debut and I knocked out the girl [Alice Yauger] I had fallen on my knees at one point and I was listening to everyone shout 'Hardy, Hardy, Hardy' and I looked up and thought 'Billy Joel sits here and they are singing my name'.",
        "\"I never let go of that.\"",

      "content": [
        "Warning: This article contains details readers may find distressing.",
        "April 3, 2005. It's 02:00 in Washington.Stephan Weiler is woken by a \"dreaded call\". A voice said: \"Is Becky Zerlentes your wife?'\"I said 'yes', and the official from Denver Health Medical Center and Hospital told me I need to get to the airport as quickly as possible. Her condition was deteriorating.\"Up until that day, a female boxer in the United States had never died in a sanctioned fight.In succumbing to that devastating blow, Zerlentes - who three years previously won a regional boxing title - had rewritten history.While the tales of fighters like Johnny Owen and Jimmy Doyle, external are enshrined in history, the impact of Zerlentes' death on the community in Denver and on those who loved her has remained private.Zerlentes' love affair with combat sports defined her life, an overwhelming rush every time she stepped inside the confines of a boxing ring or MMA cage.Like most amateur fighters, 34-year-old Zerlentes embraced a career away from the ropes, working as a geography and economics instructor at Front Range Community College's Larimer County campus, earning a master's and PhD.The buzz she enjoyed inside the classroom was complemented by her love of sport, especially in combat.On that fight night, Weiler continued his three-year stay at the Federal Reserve, the country's central banking system.He had constantly been asked by Zerlentes to return to Fort Collins, the former military outpost nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, and promised he soon would.Facing Heather Schmitz, Zerlentes was taking part in the Colorado State Boxing Senior Female Championships at the Denver Coliseum in Colorado, a venue that has crammed more than 10,000 people in when the Rolling Stones or Rage Against the Machine have been in town. Both women wore protective headgear. For two rounds Zerlentes worked, trading punches with Schmitz until the third.With a blow to the head, just above her left eye, Zerlentes staggered forward, struck the canvas and fell unconscious - a state she would remain in until her death the following morning.\"The doctor in the ring said her pupils were fixed and dilated when he saw her first and already there was a chance that brain damage had occurred,\" Weiler, now a professor, said.By 06:30 Weiler was on a flight to Denver and immediately made his way to the hospital. There he saw Zerlentes.\"The amount of damage to Becky's brain was remarkable given that it was a fairly glancing blow,\" he said.\"It was not a hard hit... but the brain had become bruised to such an extent that it could no longer operate.\"The life support Zerlentes had been placed on was beginning to fail, and that \"clinically she was probably already dead in the ring\", Weiler recalled.And then he had to make a choice.\"At about noon that morning, the decision was made, knowing that her condition was deteriorating, I made the choice that it was time, as I knew the window for organ donation, which Becky so fervently supported, was closing,\" he said.The reaction to her death was immediate.Tributes flooded in across Denver. Colleagues, students and others who knew Zerlentes described the warmth and tenacity of one of the college and community's pillars.",
        "But soon the circus arrived in town.\"I actually avoided my house because there was a Clint Eastwood movie, Million Dollar Baby, about a woman boxer, and it had just opened and was very popular when Becky died,\" Weiler said.\"They have a sort of hideaway hotel at the hospital and I just didn't want [to talk]. I mean the issue was sensationalised enough and I had no desire to feed that.\"For 10 days, Weiler kept away from his home until the reporters got tired of waiting.And so, bar one interview with the local newspaper, owing to Zerlentes' commitment to the community, Weiler went quiet.",
        "He did not return to Fort Collins for 15 months and did not go home until he was \"ready to handle the ghosts\" that remained there.Elsewhere, as the long days sank in for Weiler, Heather Schmitz was facing a battle of her own.Since her blow was responsible for the death of Zerlentes, the 20-something Schmitz was now being interviewed in relation to a homicide case by police in Denver.Schmitz, despite the ongoing investigation, reached out to Weiler. He described her tears and apologies, which he accepted, reminding the young woman that she had not meant to kill Zerlentes. The case against Schmitz was eventually dropped.In the hope of warning others about the impact boxing can have, Weiler has now decided to speak about his experience.\"It's the most male bloodlust sport,\" he said.\"And that's the only way you can talk about mixed martial arts for instance, which didn't really exist at the time. There's betting based completely on battering your opponent.\"I mean, it's one thing to do that in ping pong or table tennis - it's another thing when you're talking about somebody's life.\"Coming to terms with his grief has been a journey travelled with friends and family, but no-one who knows what he has experienced first hand - until recently.",
        "September 11, 2015. It's about 1am in Sydney.Davey Browne Jr is in hospital.\"They said if we open up his skull he would just bleed out. I made a noise that I have never made before and I have never made since. This animalistic noise. I just needed to see him.\"This is Amy Lavelle, who, like Weiler, lost her partner to boxing.Just an hour ago, Lavelle's husband was minutes away - his corner believed - from a points win over super-featherweight rival Carlo Magali, a Filipino fighter nicknamed 'The Ferocious', at Ingleburn RSL club in Sydney.Barely 30 seconds were left in the 12th and final round.Then, disaster. The 28-year-old father of two went down - it was a knockout. Initially, he rose from the canvas but moments later collapsed on his stool.By the early hours, it was clear Browne was not going to make it. Lavelle, looking at her unconscious husband, saw her world crash around her.She said: \"I just thought, how can the boys grow up without their father? How can this happen? I can't imagine them growing up without knowing him. It was unfathomable. It was just a total nightmare, a true nightmare.\"Before meeting Lavelle, Weiler had not had any contact with the authorities, promoters or managers for years.United in grief and now friends, Lavelle and Weiler seek solace in each other's shared experience. And they also agree, when it comes to support in the aftermath of this form of trauma, there has been none.Within the first few days, both were contacted by a handful of people. There is no single governing body in the world that oversees boxing, whether to set standards or uphold them. Professional fights are overseen by the area's individual commissions. At the time of Zerlentes' fight, amateur US boxing bouts were sanctioned by USA Boxing, while Browne's was sanctioned by the IBF but overseen by the Combat Sports Authority in Australia.The IBF and USA Boxing did not respond to requests for comment on this story.An inquest into Browne's death raised serious issues about governance, mandatory training for those at ringside, and those at ringside's ability to recognise serious head injury and their confidence to intervene.But ultimately, there has been silence from those wandering the corridors of boxing power.\"Which is kind of interesting,\" Weiler said. \"I mean it was so public for a while. I'd be happy to talk but I haven't heard from anyone.\"If it was down to Weiler, he would be telling every up-and-coming fighter, whether they are making their pro debut or just starting out on the pads, to thoroughly think it through before taking that first step.\"The workout is great,\" Weiler continued. \"But please think twice about having them participate in the competitive part of it.\"",
        "The situation with youngsters and long-term health implications is an obvious issue in American football. In 2016, a group of retired players who had suffered brain damage received a $1bn (£700m) settlement from the NFL.With huge collisions occurring regularly throughout matches, the sport's links to brain trauma and associated conditions are becoming more substantial. The NFL reported a 17% decrease in concussions in the 2024 season but studies suggest just three concussions can have a lasting impact.Boxers deal with similar trauma. World title challenger Heather Hardy was forced to retire last year because she was suffering from severe symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).CTE is a brain condition linked to repeated blows to the head and concussion. The condition, which gradually gets worse over time and leads to dementia, can only be diagnosed post-mortem.In February, Irishman John Cooney died because of injuries he sustained in a boxing fight in Belfast.\"The wealth these guys [American football and boxing stars] accumulate is extraordinary. But is it worth a lifetime of dementia and depression and suicidal thoughts?\" Weiler said.\"I guess everyone should make that call themselves, but they should be making that call fully aware of what the risks are.\"Lavelle agrees.\"While it's sad, it's not all totally uncomfortable, because it's my reality,\" she said.\"There needs to be some education for the athletes coming in so they know about the risks - so they are more aware of what they're getting themselves into.\"I don't think that's done. It's all just bravado and toughness.\"If you have been affected by issues raised in this article, there is information and support available on BBC Action Line.",
