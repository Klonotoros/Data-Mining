Hamilton, who celebrated his 40th birthday on 7 January, left Mercedes after winning six of his seven titles with the Silver Arrows and will now form what will likely be the strongest pairing on the grid with Charles Leclerc.",
        "Haas are starting fresh in 2025, pairing Frenchman Esteban Ocon with 19-year-old Oliver Bearman. Ocon makes the switch to the American-based team after four seasons with Alpine.

      "topic": "Norris has been through the mill - but this was a statement win",
      "content": [
        "Lando Norris said his dominant victory in the Mexico City Grand Prix has boosted his confidence that he can win his first world title this year.The Briton's lights-to-flag victory put him into the championship lead for the first time since he lost it to McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri after the Australian's victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, the fifth race of the season back in April.More than that, though, it was confirmation of a strong run of form by Norris. He has clawed back 35 points on Piastri in the five races since he retired from the Dutch Grand Prix with a fuel-line failure at the end of August.\"It gives me confidence,\" said Norris. \"One race performing well I don't think means anything. Two, three or four in a row does, so I think the last few months I've been good.\"It was also a timely reminder that, with four races now remaining as the season approaches its climax, McLaren have been the team of the year, not Red Bull.The talk coming into the weekend was all about the threat Max Verstappen posed after three victories and a second place in the past four races had seen the Dutchman cut Piastri's lead by 64 points.It did not take a maths genius to work out that if Verstappen kept that up, he would win his fifth consecutive world title at the end of the season.But, after a few races in which they felt they had underperformed as a team, Norris delivered a statement win for McLaren - and himself.",
        "The 25-year-old was in total control of the weekend from the minute he hit the track for the start of second practice, having handed his car to Mexican Indycar driver Pato O'Ward for the first session on Friday as one of the team's mandatory rookie sessions.He went on to take pole with one of the stand-out laps of the season. He brushed off the threat of the slipstream from those behind on the long run to the first corner and dodged the mayhem that unfolded behind.The only time he lost the lead was as a result of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc cutting the third corner in the midst of his battle with team-mate Lewis Hamilton just behind Norris.Once Leclerc had made amends for passing Norris illegally by letting the McLaren back past on the run to Turn Four, Norris disappeared into the distance.\"In a way, I think it's just my best performance through a whole weekend,\" added Norris. \"You know, all my laps in qualifying, all my practice, all my race.\"",
        "Norris has been through the mill this year. He started his campaign with a win in Australia, but Piastri then took control of the season and had won four races before Norris took a second.Norris could not get on with the car, which was not giving him the feelings he needed to be quick. But, following a tweak to the front suspension for the Canadian Grand Prix in June, he has slowly been working his way back into it.His win this weekend was his fourth since then. In that time, Piastri has taken only two - the last one in Zandvoort when Norris retired.At the time, that looked like a body blow to Norris' hopes. Piastri had been so convincing, so solid, that making up that sort of margin looked impossible.Norris said: \"You put that behind you, right? You forget about that as much as you can, and you just focus on every race coming up.\"Every weekend's new and you have a fresh start to try new things and try to do better than before. And I feel like that's what I've done very well this weekend.\"As Norris has found his form, Piastri started to go off the boil a little straight after Zandvoort. Norris was quicker in Italy. Piastri had a nightmare weekend in Baku, crashing three times and jumping the start.There was a bit of controversy at the start in Singapore, when Norris barged past into third place. But Piastri has been simply slow over the past two races in the US and Mexico.\"The last few have been decent,\" said Norris. \"But still a long way to go, so I just have to keep doing what I'm doing, keep trying to be consistent against some very quick guys around me. And, yeah, I think that'll be good.\"But it doesn't mean because I'm ahead or behind or whatever that I have to drive or do anything differently.\"",
        "Norris admitted after the race in Mexico that there had been times earlier this year when he \"certainly did\" doubt himself.\"When the car was winning, and Oscar was winning, the last thing I could do was use the excuse that my car wasn't good enough,\" he said.\"I wasn't getting to grips and finding a way to make it work and I'm finding a better way to make it work now, so it's as simple as that.\"It is now Piastri facing that feeling, after two difficult weekends during which he has been a fair way off the pace.\"For some reason, the last couple of weekends have required a very different way of driving,\" said Piastri.\"What's worked well for me in the last 19 races, I've needed something very different the last couple of weekends. Trying to wrap my head around why has been a bit of a struggle.\"After qualifying 0.588 seconds and seven places behind Norris in Mexico, Piastri spent Saturday night deep in the data with his engineers, trying to come up with some answers.The race was about trying to apply them - even if he was not able to get a definitive answer as to whether they had worked, given he spent most of it stuck behind other cars on his way to a fifth place that will have felt painful, but in reality amounted to a solid recovery and exercise in damage limitation.\"Ultimately today was about trying to experiment with some of those things,\" said Piastri. \"Because driving the way I've had to drive these last couple of weekends is not particularly natural for me.\"Team boss Andrea Stella had an explanation for Piastri's struggles.He said that Norris excels in low-grip conditions, whereas Piastri's driving style tends more towards high-grip levels, and he pointed out that, in only his third season, Piastri still has things to learn about adapting to different conditions.\"In the final four races, no reason to think that one may favour one driver or the other,\" said Stella, pointing to Las Vegas as the most problematic potentially for the team.\"For Lando and Oscar, there's no problem in terms of track layout coming in the next four races. If anything, we need to make sure that from a McLaren point of view, we are in condition to extract the full performance that is available in the car, like we have been able to do here in Mexico.\"The confidence in terms of the championship is increased. It's increased because we have proven that we have a car that can win races and in some conditions can dominate races. \"This is the most important factor to put Lando and Oscar in condition to pursue the drivers' championship.\"",
        "As for Verstappen, so buoyant after his win in Austin, he was feeling a lot more subdued after a messy first part of the race before fighting back to finish third behind Norris and Leclerc.Verstappen's deficit to the championship leader has reduced - from 40 points to 36. But he had clearly found Norris' pace a chastening experience.\"I lost 10 [points] to Lando, if you look at it like that,\" said Verstappen. \"I said before the weekend, everything needs to go perfect to win. And this weekend didn't go perfect. So that's your answer.\"It's going to be tough, but let's see what we can do in other tracks. I hope, of course, we won't experience a weekend like this again, but it still shows that we're not quick in every scenario. And that's what we need to understand a bit better.\"Norris, though, sees it another way.\"Max has still caught me over the last - what? - six, seven weekends.\"I've been keeping my head down, keeping focus, doing my own thing, and that's all you can do. But every weekend's new, every weekend's different, and still a long way to go.\"",

        "Oliver Bearman may be a rookie in Formula 1 but he is already proving to be an exceptional talent - even if he does still have to pinch himself over who he is competing with.\"I never thought I would be racing against Max [Verstappen] in real life, but I guess some things change,\" said the 20-year-old after a brilliant drive at Sunday's Mexico City Grand Prix saw him secure fourth place, his best-ever finish in F1.But Bearman didn't just race with Verstappen, he produced some bold and impressive driving that even the four-time world champion would have been proud of.He even kept his cool in the latter stages of the race when he was being hunted down by Oscar Piastri, who started the day as championship leader and needed to pass Bearman to ensure he left Mexico in that position.But instead Bearman held on, with Piastri's fifth-place finish and victory for his McLaren team-mate Lando Norris meaning the latter now leads the standings by one point with four races to go.Based on this showing, it is not unreasonable to predict that Bearman could one day be in the same position as fellow Brit Norris and challenging for titles.For now, however, he is just happy to be competitive with much more experienced drivers.\"Definitely a crazy race,\" he said. \"I'm a bit lost for words - at one point we were looking at the podium. I was bringing it home with a lot of nerves.\"At the end, P4 is a great result and we got both cars in the points. We really needed that good result, so I'm really, really happy.\"It was a crazy race. Good lap one - stayed out of trouble, just about.

      "content": [
        "Lando Norris has a tantalising prospect heading into the Mexico City Grand Prix - if the race ends as qualifying did, he will be leading the world championship for the first time in six months.The McLaren driver trails team-mate Oscar Piastri by 14 points heading into the race, but Norris starts on pole with the Australian down in seventh.So the reward for one of the qualifying laps of the season could be a significant statement of intent with just four grands prix remaining after this one.Arriving in Mexico, all the talk was about Red Bull's Max Verstappen and his remarkable run of form.The Dutchman had taken three wins and a second in the past four races, reducing his deficit to Piastri from 104 points to just 40.But, like Piastri, Verstappen has also had a difficult weekend, his seemingly unstoppable momentum stalled by a puzzling lack of grip.If Norris wins the race, Piastri would have to move up to fourth from his grid spot to retain even a slender lead. No easy task when the Australian has been lacking pace all weekend.But Norris is taking nothing for granted - and he knows that Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes' George Russell in the spots immediately behind him don't have the jeopardy he does, so can play with risk in a more extreme way.Sitting with Leclerc and Hamilton in the post-race news conference, Norris said of Verstappen and Piastri: \"You're talking about  - along with these guys here - two of the best drivers on the grid. So I don't think you can ever put it past them to come back through.\"From my side, our race pace has always been very strong this season, so I'm still expecting Oscar to come back through and race well. He normally does. So, let's see. That is my expectation.\"And same with Max - when has he ever not been on the attack and come forward?\"Hopefully I can just stay ahead on lap one, and then these guys can hold everyone else up for me.\"",
        "Norris got himself on to the front of the grid with what he called \"an incredible lap\".Leclerc had been fastest on the first runs in the final session and his lap was so impressive that when Norris finished his final run, although he knew it had been good, even he thought: \"If I'd get ahead of Charles, I'd be pretty happy.\"In fact, he had beaten the Ferrari by a healthy 0.262 seconds for his first pole since Belgium in late July.Norris added: \"When I saw [one minute] 15.5 on my dash, it put a pretty big smile on my face because it was one of those laps which was… everything just came together in terms of feeling.\"It was very natural and similar to my lap [to take pole] in Monaco. A good feeling, because it's been a while. It's not that often this year I get that feeling in this car, even with how quick it is.\"The car is incredibly quick, but it's not easy to drive. We both complained of that as drivers, but when you just get in that little bit of a rhythm, it's flying, and that's where I was today.\"The run from the grid to the first corner is nearly 800m, which can give an advantage to the drivers starting second and third.Both Leclerc and Hamilton, who produced his best grand prix qualifying of his maiden season at Ferrari, said they would be \"aggressive\" into the first corner. Something of which Norris knows he has to be wary.On one level, he knows he has some breathing space with Verstappen and Piastri so far behind. On another, he will want to take advantage of the opportunity this qualifying result has given him.",

But as he put it: \"What's been a bit surprising here has just been that the gap has been the same pretty much every session.\"I feel like I've done some decent laps through the weekend, but everything seems to be about 0.4-0.5secs off.\"Team principal Andrea Stella said Piastri was losing a little bit everywhere, and Piastri said: \"I feel like I did a reasonable job and the car felt reasonable as well. So, yeah, the lack of lap time is a bit of a mystery.\"Piastri has been off Norris' pace whether on short runs or long, low fuel or high, so it is more in hope that he said of the race: \"If I can unlock the pace in the car, we can have some fun. We've just got to try to unlock it.\"This is now Piastri's fifth difficult weekend in a row, his form mysteriously evaporating since he won in the Netherlands at the end of August.He did not talk directly about what this means for the championship, but there was no hiding the meaning behind one of his comments: \"There's a lot of things I could worry about, but ultimately being that far off when you feel like you've done a reasonable job is a difficult place to be. And so that's my biggest concern at the moment.\"Stella said that the conditions in Mexico, like those in Austin, are ones in which Norris thrives and Piastri is less comfortable - low grip, hot tyres.And he said that \"every evidence, every piece of data, every indirect measurement of information we have, tells us that there is no problem with the car\".He added that it was \"good\" for McLaren to be able \"to confirm that we can have the fastest car\", adding that their \"focus is to stop the momentum of Verstappen\".",

      "content": [
        "Lewis Hamilton has warned McLaren's title contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris about Max Verstappen's \"cut-throat\" character as the three head into the final five races of the season.Piastri leads the championship by 14 points from Norris, while Verstappen is 40 points off the lead after three wins and a second place in the past four races.Hamilton, who fought an intense and bitter championship battle with Verstappen in 2021, said: \"In that scenario it's challenging, the pressure is high. It is a time when you have to put your blinkers up and block everything from the outside.\"You have to be cut-throat and that is what Max is, he is going to take this from them if they don't do the same.\"You have to dig deep to hold off someone like Max and the car he is in. But also for either of them to come out ahead, consistency is key, and you've seen that from Max in the last few races.\"The seven-time champion said that Verstappen had the easiest job as the driver coming from behind - he was 104 points adrift of Piastri after the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August.\"You have three incredibly talented drivers and I can't predict how they're going to behave,\" added Hamilton.\"Max has won it four times so he knows what it's like and being the hunter is much easier than being the defender.\"When you're in the lead and someone is chopping away at your lead, that plays on you more than if you're chasing and you have nothing to lose. In the lead you have everything to lose.\"Mercedes driver George Russell, who won in Singapore two races ago, said: \"The McLaren guys have the fastest car so it's theirs to lose. But Max and Red Bull are doing an amazing job so you can never discount them.\"They showed signs of great pace at the start of the year but it was pretty inconsistent, whereas now week in, week out they are smashing it.\"",
        "The McLaren drivers go into the final five races free to race with each other and with no internal team rules hanging over them - other than not to crash with one another.Norris had been facing undefined \"repercussions\" after colliding with Piastri while taking third place from him at the first sequence of corners in Singapore.Following the crash between the two at the start of the sprint at the US Grand Prix last weekend, these have now been removed.\"There is a degree of responsibility from my side in the sprint and we are starting this weekend within a clean slate for both of us, just going out and going racing,\" said Piastri.The Australian, who won at Zandvoort, has seen his lead erode after being beaten by Norris in each of the past four races, but he said he had also been surprised Verstappen had come into the equation so quicky.\"The run of form he's had since Monza has been a bit of a surprise,\" said Piastri.\"There were flashes earlier in the season but there were also some pretty big dips. We know they have been throwing a lot of things at their car trying to improve it but he has come to the fight quicker than I expected.\"However, when asked if he was concerned about Verstappen, Piastri said: \"It's not really something I think about. He has been consistent and strong the last few weekends but there is no benefit in worrying about or focusing on that.\"The thing that's going to help me win the championship is get the most out of myself, the car, the team. He's there, he's in the fight but ultimately it doesn't change how I go about my racing.\"Norris added: \"Max has had very good form the last month or so. They have been performing better than we have.\"He has won a good amount of races and he's Max Verstappen. You'd be silly if you didn't want to give Max a chance.\"At the minute, they are in better form, a lot of races they have been quicker. But we still have chances. We have a better car from now until the end of the season and we just have to make use of that.\"Verstappen said: \"It's clear we had a good run, definitely been enjoying it a lot more like that and we will try to carry that momentum forward.

        "Why did McLaren stop upgrades on this year's car when there is no guarantee in 2026 they will have the fastest car? - JohnEvery team this year has had to face the conundrum of how long to focus on their 2025 car while also ensuring they are as prepared as they can be for the major regulation change coming for 2026.In F1, it's usually the case that if a team gets it wrong at the start of a new rules cycle, it can take a long time to catch up. And if they get it right, that advantage can last for a while - look at Red Bull in 2022 and 2023, the last time the rules changed.McLaren started this year with the best car, after putting a lot of innovation into their 2025 design.They did continue to develop it for a while, but were finding diminishing returns. So when looking at the bang for buck they were getting on their 2025 car versus 2026, it became an easy decision to switch focus to next year.Red Bull have caught up since introducing their new floor and front wing at the Italian Grand Prix, but the McLaren remains competitive - team principal Stella said he believed Lando Norris had the pace to compete for the win in Austin had he not ended up behind Charles Leclerc.As Stella put it: \"We just have to keep maximising the performance and keep executing good weekends. And from this point of view, if you think of a race like Baku, we didn't maximise the performance and we didn't execute a perfect race.\"So definitely we have a large opportunity, and the outcome of this season and the drivers' championship is in our hands. It's not in someone else's hands.\"",
        "It seems to me that both Lewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz have now proven themselves to be the equal of their team-mates in their first season at their teams. Do you think we downplay how difficult it is to switch teams? - GarethFirst of all, I'm not sure the question has an entirely accurate premise. It's true that both Hamilton and Sainz had slightly sticky first halves of the season, in different ways, and that they are now faring much better.Sainz and Alex Albon do now look very even. However, it's not so clear that, in Hamilton's case, he is yet the \"equal\" of Leclerc - or not consistently, anyway.Hamilton has not beaten Leclerc very often at all this year, either in qualifying or race.He is now much closer than he was. He is regularly qualifying within a few hundredths of a second of Leclerc, but in qualifying it's 4-2 to Leclerc since the summer break.This last weekend in Austin, on one of Hamilton's favourite circuits, he was a second behind Leclerc when the Monegasque made his pit stop, and lost 13 seconds over the rest of the race.In hindsight, Leclerc was on the best strategy. Regardless, over the season, and even now, it's hard to argue that on balance Leclerc has not been the better Ferrari driver this year.Both Hamilton and Sainz have talked about how difficult it is to switch teams, and we have to take them at their word.Hamilton would not say even now that he was fully adapted to Ferrari - and he is hoping the new rules next year will suit him; he has never really enjoyed these venturi cars.There is a lot for a driver to get their head around when they switch teams, as Hamilton has explained many times this year. But not all struggle in this way.Alonso, for example, was on it from the start of the 2023 season when he moved to Aston Martin. And would Verstappen struggle if he switched teams? I suspect most in F1 would expect not.",
        "At what point will we find out which cars/teams look to be in the running to do well next year? Will it be at pre-season testing or are there any other ways to find out aside from paddock rumours? - VictoriaUntil the cars run for the first time in pre-season testing next year, no-one will know how the teams are looking next year.The first test, in Barcelona on 26-30 January, is behind closed doors because the teams wanted to get their heads around their first running of the new engines without the prying eyes of the media.So the two tests in Bahrain on 11-13 and 18-20 February will be the first time some kind of sense of relative performance emerges.But, as ever, it's not until the first race that the true and accurate picture will emerge.",

        "It seems to me that both Lewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz have now proven themselves to be the equal of their team-mates in their first season at their teams. Do you think we downplay how difficult it is to switch teams? - Gareth",
        "First of all, I'm not sure the question has an entirely accurate premise. It's true that both Hamilton and Sainz had slightly sticky first halves of the season, in different ways, and that they are now faring much better.",
        "Sainz and Alex Albon do now look very even. However, it's not so clear that, in Hamilton's case, he is yet the \"equal\" of Leclerc - or not consistently, anyway.",

        "Hamilton would not say even now that he was fully adapted to Ferrari - and he is hoping the new rules next year will suit him; he has never really enjoyed these venturi cars.",
        "There is a lot for a driver to get their head around when they switch teams, as Hamilton has explained many times this year. But not all struggle in this way.",
        "Alonso, for example, was on it from the start of the 2023 season when he moved to Aston Martin. And would Verstappen struggle if he switched teams? I suspect most in F1 would expect not.",

        "The first test, in Barcelona on 26-30 January, is behind closed doors because the teams wanted to get their heads around their first running of the new engines without the prying eyes of the media.",
        "So the two tests in Bahrain on 11-13 and 18-20 February will be the first time some kind of sense of relative performance emerges.",

      "content": [
        "For the first time all year, Max Verstappen said after the United States Grand Prix that winning the world championship was a real possibility.It felt like a significant moment, because until now Verstappen has been dismissing the idea.That made sense during McLaren's imperious form from the beginning of the year to the end of the summer.Even when Verstappen started winning races in September, the points gap to the McLaren drivers was so big that the four-time champion refused to entertain the idea in public, even if he might have been thinking about it in private. He was taking it race by race, he said, and not thinking about the championship.Verstappen said the same thing at the start of the weekend in Austin, even though he had won two of the past three grands prix and finished second in the other. A McLaren had not finished ahead of him since the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August.After a race weekend in which Verstappen took pole and victory in both the sprint and grand prix itself, he could have said it again. He might even have been expected to. But the belief in him now was almost palpable.\"For sure, the chance is there,\" Verstappen said. \"We just need to try and deliver these kind of weekends to the end. We will try. It is exciting.\"Of course we know we need to be perfect to the end of the season to have a chance, but we will try, and if we succeed, of course amazing.\"If we don't, we tried everything we could to the end and we kept it exciting. That's the spirit for us. It's positive pressure. It's not putting anything on us. We're not stressed about it. We're just going flat out.\"",
        "The statistics of the last four races over the past month and a half are quite remarkable.After the Dutch Grand Prix, Verstappen was 104 points behind McLaren's Oscar Piastri in the championship, and 70 adrift of Lando Norris. Now, he is 40 points behind the Australian, whose lead over his team-mate has been cut to just 14 points.Verstappen expressed his own incredulity at what he had achieved. If someone had told him after Zandvoort this would happen, he said, \"I would have told him he was an idiot.\"But we found a good way with the car. It's simple as that. Of course, we put some upgrades on the car, but we just understood our car a bit better, where we wanted it to perform better.\"A 64-point gain in four races tells its own story, but how it has come about is just as remarkable.McLaren trounced Red Bull through the summer races in Europe - until the Italian Grand Prix in early September, when an upgraded floor and front wing finally gave Verstappen the balance he had been craving all year.Since then, the Red Bull has been the fastest car. Until this weekend in Austin, that could have been explained away through circuit characteristics - Monza, Baku and Singapore are all short, slow corners, and require good braking and traction.The McLaren's strengths are not in this area - they are in long-duration, medium-speed corners, where they crush everyone else.But Austin is a \"normal\" circuit, a road course not a street circuit, not a high-speed outlier like Monza, with a good range of corners. And Verstappen won again.There are five races left, two of them sprint events. If he keeps closing on the McLaren drivers at the rate he has been, he will win a fifth consecutive title, it's as stark and simple as that.",
        "There are circuits to come that play to McLaren's strengths - Brazil, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, the team have singled out.But Verstappen's recent form brings everything into question.On Saturday in Austin, McLaren team principal Andrea Stella was saying that the Verstappen-Red Bull combination could be the fastest at every remaining track this year.By Sunday, though, Stella's tone in public had become more positive. He was encouraged, he said, by the fact that Norris \"had the pace to win the race today\".This, Stella said, had been proved on the few laps Norris was able to run his pace. Verstappen agreed.\"As soon as Lando was in clean air,\" the Dutchman said, \"it was very evenly matched or he was slightly faster. We managed to gap to the end but it was not super-easy.\"Norris' problem was that he spent the vast majority of the race stuck behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.Ferrari were the only team to pick the right strategy. Leclerc started on soft tyres, which gave him the grip off the line to pass Norris into the first corner.Most teams started on the mediums, expecting the race to be a one-stop on the medium and hard tyres. But it soon became apparent in the first stint that the cars who had started on hards were struggling.",
        "Leclerc held Norris back for the entire first stint. He pitted first, fitting the medium tyres, while the McLaren driver stayed out on his mediums. When Norris finally pitted, fitting the softs instead of the hards that had been the plan at the start of the race, he emerged behind Leclerc again, inevitably.He expected to be able to pass relatively easily, but although he caught the Ferrari quickly, Leclerc fended him off again. Norris backed off to cool his tyres and had another go, and it was not until five laps from the end that he was finally able to claim second place.Had he held on to it at the start, the race could have been very different. \"Performance-wise,\" Stella said, \"we are reassured that the pace was sufficient to fight for the victory.\"This was especially encouraging because the crash between the McLaren drivers that had taken them both out of the sprint on the first lap had cost them valuable learning.That meant McLaren had had to be conservative with their set-up, especially in terms of ride height, because they lacked the necessary data on a track where other teams have in the past been caught out by the bumps and been disqualified for excessive floor wear.McLaren had to err on the side of caution, and it inevitably cost them performance. Hence the encouragement from the fact that, despite that compromise, they were nevertheless competitive in the race.",
        "As Verstappen closes on both McLaren drivers, so Norris has been closing on Piastri - he was 34 points behind his team-mate after Zandvoort; he has now reduced that by more than half.Piastri finished behind Norris in Monza, had a very poor weekend in Baku, and lost out in Singapore when Norris barged past him at the first corner.This weekend was different. He lacked pace from the off, never comfortable with the car, always lagging about 0.2secs behind his team-mate.\"I don't think there's an overwhelming trend that things are in a bad way,\" Piastri said. \"It's just that this weekend has been has been tough. So we'll try and understand why that was the case. And try and bounce back next week.\"He denied that the pressure was getting to him.\"No, I don't think so,\" Piastri said. \"The pressure has been there the whole year.  This weekend, I didn't really feel like I made any mistakes. It just wasn't very fast.\"There's some weekends where it just doesn't click for you. And this was one of those. When you feel like you've done a reasonable job and just the pace hasn't been there, I don't think that's really what pressure looks like.\"I've been in fights that were as close or at this point even closer than what they are now. So I've got the evidence for myself that things can still turn out well and I still fully believe that I can win the championship.\"There's still a long way to go in the championship. Max has obviously chased it down pretty quick, but it's not exactly a small gap with five rounds to go.\"Ultimately, if we can find our way again, find our pace, certainly for me find our pace again, then I don't have any major concerns.\"",
        "Norris, Piastri and McLaren as a whole are heading into new territory.The drivers and the team have not fought for a drivers' title before, although Norris threatened Verstappen last year. The only exception is Stella, who is the veteran of many close battles, when he was race engineer for Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso at Ferrari.His job now is to keep the team and drivers on an even keel, to try to brush off the pressure and focus on the job in hand.\"We keep talking about the fact that what we are facing in this moment - which is a tight competition to win races, a tight competition in the quest for the drivers' championship - is what Formula 1 is about,\" Stella said.\"If anything, it was anomalous when we were doing easily P1, P2, like in Barcelona, in Bahrain, and some other places.

It's more people further back just being a bit careless and we are the consequence of that.\"Piastri told Sky Sports: \"I've not seen the incident from the TV cameras but I obviously had a pretty good start.\"We both went pretty deep into Turn One. I tried to cut back and got a hit. Not a great way to start the day. I need to have another look.\"",
        "Piastri made a better start than Norris and initially moved to attack his team-mate on the outside as they approached the first corner with its wide, uphill entry.The Australian then went for the inside in the hope of getting the cutback on Norris, but in doing so his left rear wheel caught the right front of Hulkenberg's car.That launched Piastri into the air and as he bounced back on to the track, he collected Norris. The Briton was out on the spot while Piastri limped on for a few corners further before pulling off.It was exactly what McLaren management did not want. All year they have been emphasising that the drivers were free to race but the first rule was that they must not crash into each other.The start of the Austin weekend has been dominated by discussion of the small touch between them in Singapore two weeks ago, when Norris bounced into Piastri after clipping Verstappen.Norris received \"consequences\" for that, and it remains to be seen how McLaren will handle the fall-out from this situation as they seek to keep the relationship between the two drivers cool in the heat of a title battle.",
        "The crash was a gift for Verstappen, who McLaren have always insisted remained a threat in the championship despite his significant deficit, especially as Red Bull have returned to form in recent races.The crash brought out the safety car for five laps and after the restart Verstappen was tracked by Russell, who made a bold move into Turn 12 on lap seven, a late dive that ended up with both going off the track.Verstappen retained the position and soon began to edge away and took control of the race.Sainz was no threat to Russell, but he had to watch his mirrors for Hamilton.The seven-time champion passed team-mate Charles Leclerc on lap eight down the back straight after the Monegasque lost control of his car through the high-speed Esses earlier in the lap.Leclerc had a snap through the Esses, cut one of the corners, and that allowed Hamilton to close up. He then passed down the straight as Leclerc edged him right to the edge of the track on the inside.Leclerc tried to fight back through the series of slower corners through the stadium section but Hamilton held on.Leclerc took fifth place, with Williams' Alex Albon sixth and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda seventh.Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli took the final point after a 10-second penalty for Haas driver Oliver Bearman, who was adjudged to have gained an advantage by leaving the track after the Italian tried a passing move into Turn 12 late in the race.Bearman could not believe the penalty when told about it by his team during the race, obviously feeling Antonelli had forced him off track with his late move.The race ended under another safety car after Aston Martin's Lance Stroll T-boned Esteban Ocon's Haas into the first corner, leaving his team with a massive repair job on both cars in the gap before grand prix qualifying.Stroll was later given a five-place grid penalty for Sunday's grand prix, as well as two penalty points on his licence.",

        "Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff said in the statement that announced George Russell and Kimi Antonelli would be staying with the team in 2026 that \"confirming our driver line-up was always just a matter of when, not if\".Yet for some time this season there very much was doubt about who would be driving for the former champions next season.The spectre of Max Verstappen has hung heavily over both Mercedes drivers for a fair portion of this season - and Russell more so than Antonelli.Wolff said at the Australian Grand Prix at the start of the season that a move for Verstappen was \"not on any radar\".But it was a statement that reflected Wolff's acceptance that the prospects of attracting Verstappen were relatively distant, and was aimed at deflecting disruptive questions.It did not change the fact that Wolff was interested in Verstappen, and everybody in F1 knew it.Wolff tried to get the Dutchman last year, before eventually admitting defeat. And they had talks again this season.It was Russell who explicitly spelled out what was happening, at the Austrian Grand Prix at the end of June.\"It's only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing,\" Russell said. \"But from my side, if I'm performing as I'm doing, what have I got to be concerned about? There are two seats in every Formula 1 team.\"That was a reference to Russell's emphatic victory in the previous race in Canada, and to the fact that the Briton was already by that point not only having arguably his best season in F1, but comfortably outperforming his highly touted rookie team-mate.Finally, at the Hungarian Grand Prix at the end of July, Verstappen put the story to bed by saying it was \"time basically to stop all the rumours\".",
        "That same weekend, Russell let slip something of the level of discomfort the saga had produced in him.Russell, who is managed by Mercedes as well as employed by them, knew before flying to Hungary that prospects of a deal with Verstappen were over, so he was prepared.Discussing the prospect of a new contract for himself, he said: \"Whenever we come to an agreement, we will get it done, but it has to work for both of us.\"Something we need to think about. What do they want and what do I want?\"We have been in a bit of a unique situation for the last few months. I don't have huge power in this agreement. And maybe interests were not aligned for the last six months. But it's my job to perform and reduce that risk.\"I still trust Toto and the team will continue to support me, but for Kimi and me the last six months have not been the most assuring and that is conflicting.\"All of this might seem harsh on Russell to some. This is a driver who not only beat Lewis Hamilton in two of the three seasons they spent as team-mates from 2022-2024, but who was also this season answering any remaining doubts Mercedes might have had about whether he was ready to step up as team leader following the seven-time champion's departure.",
        "Job security is not a luxury many F1 drivers enjoy, even those, like Russell, who can count themselves among the very best on the grid.Russell would be close to the top of anyone's list of best-performing F1 drivers this season, indeed for the last several seasons. But there is a pecking order in F1, and Verstappen is at the top.Had Verstappen not been a possibility, a new contract with Russell would have been a no-brainer for Mercedes. But he was, so it wasn't.Russell did not know that it would be him to make way if Wolff had succeeded in landing the four-time world champion, but he had a good idea that would probably be the case.On paper, the logical person to move aside had Verstappen switched to Mercedes would have been Antonelli.He is a rookie, his first season has had plenty of downs as well as a few ups, and Russell has been performing comfortably better than him.But the idea of Russell and Verstappen being team-mates hardly seems realistic. The two are not exactly best mates. They get on well enough if they end up in the same news conference after a qualifying session or race, even share the odd joke, but there is a mutual antipathy that was laid bare in their public row towards the end of last season.",
        "With Verstappen out of the picture at Mercedes for the time being, Russell said he wanted to take some time to think about how he wanted the relationship to work in the future.Considering neither party had a better option, and both were insistent that a deal would get done, the subsequent talks have taken some time.One of Russell's considerations was the new rules that are being introduced next year for both cars and engines.Mercedes are widely believed within F1 to be ahead when it comes to the performance of the new power-units, which will have a much greater proportion of their performance coming from the electrical part of the engine, as well as run on sustainable fuels.But what if they are not? Mercedes' statement made no mention of the length of the drivers' contracts, beyond saying only that they would race for the team \"into 2026\".Russell's new deal is said to be \"multi-year\". But that could just as easily mean one fixed year plus options for another one or two as it could two fixed years plus an option for another one.It would be a surprise if Russell had not negotiated some degree of flexibility in the event that Mercedes are not competitive next year.Flexibility works both ways, of course, and the chances of Wolff giving up on his desire to have Verstappen at Mercedes in the future are not great.",

Whether you're in the car, outside the car, you just need to cope with that.

      "topic": "Horner, the £52m pay-off, and what next for ex-Red Bull boss?",
      "content": [
        "Christian Horner formally leaves Red Bull a very rich man with unsated ambitions in Formula 1.The severance of the 51-year-old's links with the team he made one of the most successful in the sport was confirmed on Monday.Red Bull gave no details about the settlement terms, but BBC Sport has been told by a source close to the team that Horner secured a pay-off worth 60m euros (£52m).The move frees Horner up to return to F1 in the future - if he can find a project that is willing to take him on board.But what are the chances of that, why has he been paid off in such a way, and how will this reflect on Horner and Red Bull?",
        "Different figures have been published for Horner's settlement.BBC Sport is confident in the source behind the figure of 60m euros. Others have reported it as more - the Daily Mail says 92m euros (£80m), while motorsport website The Race has said $100m (£74m).Ultimately, no-one other than Red Bull and Horner and their respective lawyers can be absolutely sure without seeing the documentation, to which they will not be privy. Equally, more information tends to come out as time passes.Horner's salary is said to have been 12m euros (£10m), and his contract ran to the end of 2030. He was sacked as team principal on 9 July this year.So, a 60m euros settlement essentially equates to the last five years of his contract being paid out.It might seem odd that someone should be sacked and then paid his full salary, but it is not uncommon in sport.Football managers who are dismissed for poor results, for example, regularly receive large payouts, such as former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag last year. All such situations end up in a negotiation.In this case, presumably Horner and his lawyers would argue that he did not deserve to be sacked, and should receive compensation on top of his salary - and start with a high number.Red Bull would argue the sacking was justified, and therefore that if there was to be a settlement figure, it should be considerably lower. There may also have been a desire to reward him for the success to which he led the team, regardless of how the relationship ended.In the end, a compromise is reached with which all parties can live.But the High Pay Centre, a UK think-tank that analyses issues relating to top incomes, corporate governance and business performance, says this level of payout \"would be considered extraordinarily large by the standards of even the biggest companies in Europe\".It adds that the sum would \"raise questions in the corporate world\".\"Most CEO incentive payments are paid in shares which they have to hold for a period of years, in case any wrongdoing comes to light or if the long-term impact of their decisions proves to be less positive than anticipated,\" it says.\"Paying £50m cash to one individual in a lump sum is a very casual way to spend an enormous sum of money.\"For comparison, Horner's salary would be in the top 10 in the UK if he had been a chief executive officer (CEO) of a FTSE 100 company.But Red Bull is a private company based in Austria. Comparing with similar situations in the US, Horner's payout would still be high, but by no means the highest.The CEO of US drug company Moderna, Stephane Bancel, received an exit package worth $926m, external in 2019. And co-working space provider WeWork paid its founder Adam Neumann an exit package worth $445m, external in 2021.",
        "To people outside F1 the numbers may look disproportionately large, but there is a lot of money in the sport.For example, Red Bull driver Max Verstappen's basic salary is believed to be 75m euros (£65m). With bonuses and endorsements, the four-time champion is said to earn well over 100m euros (£87m) a year.And this level of money is fairly insignificant to a company of the size and wealth of Red Bull, which reported revenues of 11.2bn euros (£9.8bn) in 2024.From Red Bull's point of view, they have got rid of an executive in whom they no longer had confidence and can now move forward having ended the saga in reasonably short order - it is two and a half months since they revealed news of Horner's sacking.Horner was already a rich man, and is now even richer. But his reputation will forever be linked to this saga, for good and ill.He is the man who was entrusted by the late Red Bull co-owner Dietrich Mateschitz with setting up an F1 team at the age of 31 in 2005.When Red Bull entered F1, they were considered by rivals a bit of a joke - viewed as a party team that played loud music and not to be taken seriously.But that soon changed - pretty much from the moment Horner secured the services of Adrian Newey, who joined as technical director in 2006. Newey was already regarded with reverence following his success with Williams and McLaren. He is even more so now.Together, Horner and the man who is viewed by many as the greatest F1 designer in history built a monolith that won eight drivers' championships, six constructors' titles and 124 grands prix.Horner will be remembered as one of the most successful team bosses in history.But he is also the man who was sacked by Red Bull after, essentially, getting too big for his boots in the eyes of his employers, and presiding over an extraordinary 18-month period of decline.Horner upset the Mateschitz family - who own 49% of Red Bull - by manoeuvring to his own advantage even before their patriarch died of cancer in October 2022.Mateschitz's death began to peel back the veil over an internal power struggle at Red Bull between Horner and Helmut Marko, the Austrian former racing driver who was Mateschitz's right-hand man.The power struggle intensified after it became public knowledge in February 2024 that a female employee had accused Horner of sexual harassment and coercive, controlling behaviour.In the end, Verstappen felt he had to step in to back Marko, who remains with the team.Horner has always denied the allegations, and they were dismissed following two internal investigations in the course of 2024.The details of the negotiations that led to Horner's settlement, and the arguments made by each party that led to the final figure, can of course not be known.",
        "In addition to being the team principal who headhunted Newey, Horner was also the team boss who lost him.Newey resigned in April 2024, and the allegations by the female employee were a central part of his reasoning, along with his feeling that his contribution was being undervalued by some in the team, including Horner.Three months later, Red Bull also lost long-time sporting director Jonathan Wheatley.By then, Red Bull's competitiveness was on the slide.Verstappen took dominant championship wins in 2022 and 2023 to add to the maiden title he won controversially at Abu Dhabi in 2021.But after a successful start to the 2024 season, Red Bull's form dipped. They faced a renewed challenge from a revitalised McLaren. But this decline also coincided with Newey's departure - and was directly linked to it, according to former Red Bull driver Sergio Perez, who was sacked at the end of 2024.Verstappen held on to win the 2024 title, despite winning only two of the last 14 races. But that slump continued into this season. Verstappen won just twice between the start of 2025 and Horner's dismissal.And even Verstappen's future was in doubt this year, following his courtship by Mercedes, until he confirmed he would stick to his contract, something he made clear only after Horner's departure.All of which leads to a legitimate question - given how Red Bull's competitiveness declined in the wake of Newey's resignation, how should the responsibility for the success of Red Bull over the past two decades be split between Newey and Horner?In the past two races in Italy and Azerbaijan, Red Bull have returned to form with two dominant Verstappen victories.This follows the introduction of a new floor design, but Verstappen has also praised the manner in which new team principal Laurent Mekies has refocused the technical department.\"Up until now,\" the Dutchman said in Monza, \"we've had a lot of races where we were just shooting left and right a little bit with the set-up of the car. Quite extreme changes, which shows that we were not in control. We were not fully understanding what to do.\"With Laurent having an engineering background, he's asking the right questions to the engineers - common-sense questions - so I think that works really well.\"The underlying implication there is hard to miss, especially in the context of the difficult relationship Horner had with Verstappen's father, former F1 driver Jos Verstappen.As for how people not related to the situation feel about Horner being paid this sort of money following everything that has happened - well, that is down to personal opinion.",
        "Horner has made it clear to senior figures inside F1 that he wants to return to the sport.But he does not want just any job. Being a team principal on its own is not enough, they say. He wants to be a shareholder, and he wants ultimate authority. Essentially, he wants the same status as his nemesis at Mercedes, Toto Wolff.The settlement with Red Bull has made Horner very wealthy, but almost certainly not wealthy enough either to set up his own team, or buy a majority shareholding in an existing one.Not when F1 team valuations start these days at £1bn and go up from there - world champions McLaren were recently valued at £3.5bn following a change in shareholding. So if he is to have a shareholding in a team, Horner would likely have to find an investor who wants to back him. And of course if he was anything but a majority shareholder, he would not have control.Horner has the sort of record in terms of on-track performance that could make him very appealing to a wealthy investor who wants to make a success of their F1 team.But after the past 18 months or so, he also comes with a lot of baggage.Additional reporting by Mitch Labiak, BBC business reporter",

        "Oscar Piastri says McLaren are \"very aligned\" on their approach to racing in the title fight between him and team-mate Lando Norris.The Australian said he \"trusted\" the team in the wake of discussions following the events of the Italian Grand Prix, where Piastri was asked to hand second place to Norris after a pit-stop problem for the Briton.Piastri leads Norris by 31 points heading into this weekend's Azerbaijan Grand Prix.\"A highly talked about moment. We've clarified a lot of things, and we know how we're going to go racing moving forward. What's happened is done,\" said Piastri.\"We've had a lot of discussions about how we want to go racing and a lot of that is to stay for us.\"If we give out that info, we become very easy targets to pick off because everyone knows what we're going to do. It is all very aligned but it stays in-house.\"",
        "Piastri said McLaren's decision to reverse the order of the cars was made because of the team's sequence of decisions leading up to the pit stops.Norris had been the lead McLaren all race, but the team decided to stop Piastri first rather than Norris, against normal convention.Piastri's stop went cleanly, but Norris lost four seconds at his because of a problem fitting his left front wheel. That led to Norris losing second place.Because the team had made the decision to stop in an unusual order, McLaren decided the right thing to do was to restore the natural order of the race, even though they had agreed beforehand that a pit-stop problem was a natural event of racing that would not necessarily lead to such a call.Piastri added: \"From Monza, there was another factor outside of the slow pit stop, being the order we pitted in. That was a contributing factor to why we swapped.\"That one I'm happy to talk about because it happened. We can't plan for every scenario but we are very aligned and I respect the team's decisions and trust they will do their best to make the right one.\"The biggest thing for me from Monza was it was a weekend where I deserved to finish third. I didn't deserve to finish second because of the pace I had. I was quick at certain points but not quick enough the whole weekend. That is my main takeaway from that.\"Piastri said he \"stood by\" his remarks made over the radio during the race about slow pit stops being part of racing.\"That is a decision we've made, that a slow pit stop is a part of racing,\" he said. \"In the car, the context wasn't there about what else had happened in terms of the pit stop sequencing. So it was decided there was another factor for the reasoning in swapping.\"",
        "Meanwhile, Norris said he expects Ferrari and Red Bull - second and fourth respectively in the constructors' standings - to be quick on the Azerbaijan street circuit, but added: \"I'm confident I can have a good weekend and my goal of course is to win.\"Norris' second place at Monza came after his retirement with an oil leak at the Dutch Grand Prix last month. While both he and Piastri were back on the podium together in Italy, the pace of race winner Max Verstappen and Red Bull made Norris reflect on how McLaren were \"simply not quick enough\". He said: \"It shows we're vulnerable but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. I will try to use it as an advantage. \"If we are just first and second every weekend, it makes my life even trickier. So I will try to take advantage of that. But we've both been performing at a high level and it's going to be tricky. \"But I am doing everything I can and that's all I can ask of myself.\" Norris, who has five grands prix wins this year, is 63 points clear of third-placed Verstappen in the championship and acknowledged that the Dutchman taking points off his title rival Piastri in the final seven races would boost his own chances. \"Sometimes it might help,\" he said.",

It is a pretty remarkable position we are in to be even talking about clinching the constructors' championship this early.\"Just a very proud moment for everyone, myself included, and just excited to get back in the car and drive all their hard work.\"Norris added it will be a \"wonderful thing\" if the team can seal the title in Baku. \"To be here and ready to wrap up the championship is a pretty huge achievement,\" he said.

        "The lap with which Max Verstappen set a new all-time Formula 1 record on his way to pole position at the Italian Grand Prix surpassed the performance of the cars still considered the fastest in the sport's history.Both Verstappen and McLaren's Lando Norris beat the previous record, set by Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes at the same race in 2020.Those cars were designed to a different set of rules and generally hold the lap records for most circuits.Norris was the first to beat Hamilton's average of 164.286mph with his lap of one minute 18.869 seconds, which is 164.323mph. Verstappen then crossed the line a few seconds later and lowered the mark to 1:18.792 (164.466mph).",
        "It came about through a confluence of circumstances.The current cars have less drag than those in 2020, so are faster on the straights, and at Monza cars spend longer at full throttle than anywhere else.On top of that, Monza was resurfaced before last year's race, and the new surface has more grip than the old, worn-out one on which Hamilton set the previous record.Verstappen said: \"Honestly, I didn't even think about that when I crossed the line, but it's nice. It didn't feel too bad. The cars have been fun.\"They are pretty decent in the high speed (corners). They're quite quick in a straight line.\"Of course, the low speed (corners), that's where we lose out compared to the previous generation (of cars). And yeah, on some tracks you can do these lap records now.\"Also, the new Tarmac helps around here, kerbing (too). Like, the kerbs opened up a little bit.\"I think the 2020 Mercedes is still quicker if you would put it on the track now, but it's been good. At some tracks it's more fun than others.\"",
        "Verstappen's time is the latest in a long line of fastest-ever laps, many set at Monza. Before Hamilton, Kimi Raikkonen held the record with his pole for Ferrari from 2018.That beat the previous record that had stood for 14 years - a lap Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya set in a Williams with a V10 BMW engine in 2004 at an average speed of 162.95mph.Some in F1 still get misty-eyed over the sound of those V10 engines, which were naturally aspirated, so the noise was not reduced by turbos or hybrid systems, or both as now, and revved to 20,000rpm.This is partly what is behind the current push off-track from FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem for a return to naturally aspirated engines - on which there has been a development this weekend in Italy. Montoya first returned the record to Monza in 2002. Before that, the fastest ever lap was an iconic performance from Keke Rosberg in a Williams at the 1985 British Grand Prix, the last race on a long-lived Silverstone layout, which was the first to break the 160mph barrier at 160.938mph.Remarkably, the Finn, the 1982 world champion, performed that lap on a rear tyre that was developing a slow puncture.It is unlikely Verstappen's record will be broken for some time. Next year sees the introduction of new chassis and engine rules and the cars are expected to be slower than currently by about a couple of seconds a lap - although they may well be faster on the straights.",
        "Verstappen has not won since the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix in May.One might have expected the four-time champion to be pessimistic of turning this into a win, as the McLaren has generally had a much bigger advantage in races this year than in qualifying, because it is so good on its tyres.But Verstappen was relatively optimistic after qualfiying.\"I don't sit here and think it is going to be easy to be in front of McLaren,\" he said. \"The whole season has shown that.\"This season we have had a few good qualifyings but in the race we always seem to struggle a little bit compared to them.\"I am going to give it a good go.

I'm not sure it is going to be enough but if we can do something similar and they don't improve too much then I have a feeling that maybe we have a chance.\"To stay here will be tough but we will see what we can do.\"McLaren team principal Andrea Stella explained the technical reasons why Verstappen might be more competitive over a race distance this weekend than previously.Stella explained that the McLaren was the fastest car in the corners but was losing time on the straights in qualifying.\"In racing, the corners become quite a bit longer, because you brake earlier, you go later on throttle, so the grip-limited area extends, and this would make our car just naturally more competitive,\" he said.\"However, from what we have seen in terms of lap times in practice, if we take the lap times that Verstappen was able to do, they were very comparable to ours. I think he has done a whole long run in 1.23s, which is very fast, very competitive.\"We have seen good lap times for Ferrari, good lap times for Mercedes.\"The Tarmac is very high grip after the resurface last year. I think there won't be necessarily much degradation, and it won't be the natural characteristic of McLaren being very good when the grip is low.\"I think the field will be much more compact, not only in qualifying like we have seen today, but also in the race.\"",

      "content": [
        "This Formula 1 title fight between McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri just refuses to get nasty, even when the team find themselves embroiled in controversy of their own making.The Italian Grand Prix threw up the sort of situation that in many - if not most - cases in F1 would be expected to generate acrimony.For most of the race, Norris and Piastri ran second and third behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen, the Dutchman too fast for Norris, and Norris too fast for Piastri.But in throwing the strategy dice by running their cars as long as possible before a pit stop, and then deciding to stop them in the 'wrong' order, McLaren generated a problem for themselves.Piastri was stopped first, when normally in that situation it would be Norris. The Briton said it was fine as long as it did not lead to Piastri ending up ahead of him. The team reassured him it would not.But it did. In theory, Norris had a gap more than big enough to stop and re-emerge in front. But he had a problem at his pit stop, and came out behind his team-mate.The team asked Piastri to let him back past. The Australian said he didn't understand but agreed anyway, and they finished Norris-Piastri, the latter's championship lead down by three points to 31.This very much did not go as would have been expected in previous intra-team title fights.The typical sort of response to this situation would be for a driver in Piastri's position to refuse to let his team-mate back past. Or to take a lot longer to do it, while complaining vociferously. Or criticise the team afterwards.It's clear how the winner of the race would have responded if he was in that situation.\"Hah,\" Verstappen said when told about the swap. \"Just because they had a slow stop?\"But then McLaren are very much not running their team in the normal way.",
        "For McLaren team principal Andrea Stella, McLaren's \"racing principles\" are everything, and at the heart of them is fairness.Stella saw this as a very simple situation. Norris deserved second place. The team chose to stop Piastri first, against the normal convention that the lead driver gets priority with strategy. They had their reasons, and they did so with the express intention not to change the order. The order changed because of a team problem over which neither driver had any influence. So the only fair reaction was to revert the positions.\"The pit stop situation is not only a matter of fairness, it's a matter of consistency with our principles,\" Stella said. \"And however the championship goes, what's important is that the championship runs within the principles and the racing values that we have at McLaren, and that we have created together with our drivers.\"The fact that we went first with Oscar, compounded by the slow pit stop of Lando, then led to a swap of positions. And we thought it was absolutely the right thing to go back to the situation pre-existing the pit stop, and then let the guys race.\"This is what we did, and this is what we think is in compliance with our principles.\"Piastri disagreed during the race. \"We said that a slow pit stop was part of racing,\" he said, \"so I don't really get what changed here. But I'll do it.\"Once out of the car, however, the adrenaline now beginning to drain out of him, he said he agreed with the decision.\"It's something that we'll discuss,\" he said. \"We have discussed it before. Today was a fair request. Lando qualified ahead, was ahead the whole race, and lost that spot through no fault of his own.\"I said what I had to say on the radio. And once I got the second request, then I'm not going to go against the team.\"Norris said: \"If it was the other way around, I would have had to do it. It proves we're a fair team, it's why we're the best team, just because others haven't done that doesn't meant they're right.\"As a team we believe in our own ways, we do it our own way.\"",
        "McLaren have previous experience of this sort of situation.In Hungary last year, Piastri was on his way to his maiden win, but McLaren chose to pit Norris before him, saying they were worried about a threat from Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes behind.They knew it would end up with Norris in front of Piastri, but figured they would revert the cars, and trusted Norris to do so. But when they asked him to swap back, it took more than 10 laps and lots of pleading from the team before Norris agreed.At the time, the threat from Hamilton was so distant as to be almost a figment of the imagination. It felt like McLaren had dug a hole for themselves and thrown themselves needlessly into it.This situation was not dissimilar.Stella said that the decision to pit Piastri first was made to protect him from the threat of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who had pitted several laps before and was closing on fresh tyres.But Leclerc was 28.5 seconds behind Piastri when McLaren stopped the Australian, and closing at about 0.5secs a lap. The total pit-stop time loss at Monza was 25secs.So McLaren had at least another three or four laps, and probably more, before they really had to worry about Leclerc. In other words, they really did not need to make this decision - they could have stopped Norris first and then Piastri and not had this problem at all.Of course, in that situation, had Piastri stopped second, and had he had the same wheel-gun problem as Norris, he, too, would have lost four seconds - and then he would have been under threat from Leclerc. But McLaren didn't know that at the time.So the decision does not really make sense, at least not on that reasoning. Stella said after the race: \"This is something I will review with the strategy team.\"The strategy team elaborated that that was the right sequencing because there could have been some threat for Oscar. We will review the numbers and we will check whether that was necessary or not.\"There is, though, one logical reason for the order of pit stops, even if Stella did not say it.Had McLaren stopped Norris first and then there had been a safety car during the lap before Piastri stopped, then that would have put Piastri ahead. Perhaps that's really what McLaren were tying to avoid.",
        "What's remarkable about all this is the equanimity with which McLaren's drivers are dealing with this specific situation, and the wider championship battle.It speaks to their particular characters, but also how much Stella has managed to get the whole McLaren team to buy into his culture.It's a culture - and leadership - that in two short years has turned the team from low-midfield runners at the start of 2023, just after Stella took over, into constructors' world champions last year, and now the dominant force in F1 this year.Racing drivers are in a unique position. They are competitive athletes out for personal success. But they are dependent on their team for the machinery with which they will achieve it.Usually, in F1, those two, powerful opposing forces are what create the on-track drama and off-track tension between team-mates contesting a title.This happened with Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at Mercedes, Piastri's manager Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel at Red Bull, Hamilton and Fernando Alonso at McLaren, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at McLaren, Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet at Williams, and so on.Stella's achievements at McLaren are multi-faceted. But managing to control this is certainly among the most remarkable.Both drivers have bought into this.As Piastri said: \"We don't want the chance of success just for this year. There's a big regulation change next year. We don't know how competitive we're going to be, and we don't know how competitive anyone's going to be.\"Ultimately, we want the best chance at winning championships for as long as we're Formula 1 drivers, and we're both at McLaren for a very long time.\"Protecting the people around us that give us this opportunity is a very important thing. It's easy enough to put yourself second at times like that.\"Norris added: \"That was beautiful. He said it well. I don't need to add any more.\"Before the race, there was another - much less publicised and obvious example of this.In qualifying, Piastri was asked by the team to give Norris a tow in the second session.  At the time, Norris was in danger of being knocked out - which would have meant qualifying out of the top 10 and giving Piastri a massive helping hand in the championship.But Piastri agreed without hesitation.Afterwards, Stella was asked whether he would accept it if that sort of thing stopped happening as the title fight came to a climax.He said: \"I would consider it relatively, potentially not the most elegant move. But sometimes racing doesn't necessarily require elegance as long as you operate within the principles and the rules of the team.\"",

      "content": [
        "DRS in Formula 1 stands for Drag Reduction System - a device controlled via the steering wheel that allows drivers to increase speed and overtake.After pressing the DRS button, a flap on the car's rear wing opens, reducing drag by allowing air to flow through the wing.DRS can only be used in designated zones on circuits, primarily along straights. These zones are determined by detection points.A driver must be within one second of the car in front at the detection point in order to use DRS, which helps drivers overtake and escape the 'dirty air' created by the car ahead.It is only available in dry conditions and is disabled during wet races.The system - first introduced in 2011 - was implemented to increase the chances of on-track overtaking.Drivers are notified via their steering wheel display when DRS is available.In practice sessions and qualifying, DRS can be used freely within the activation zones to help set faster lap times.The number of DRS zones varies by circuit - for example, Monaco has just one, while the Australian Grand Prix features four.",
        "DRS will be removed in 2026 as part of new Formula 1 regulations.Instead, all cars will be able to activate a low-drag mode on straights at any time, regardless of proximity to another car.Two separate power-boost modes will replace DRS on the steering wheel.'Z-mode' opens elements on the front and rear wings to increase downforce and speed through corners.Drivers can switch to 'X-mode', which reduces drag to maximise straight-line speed.These modes will be available in specific zones around each track and can be activated manually by the driver.",
        "The idea behind the DRS overtaking aid was to create a sticking-plaster solution to the problem created by aerodynamics in F1.That is, make the car's performance dependent on downforce, and overtaking will always be hard because the disruption to the airflow over a car behind another reduces its grip and makes it hard to follow closely.DRS was meant to simulate a slipstream - a straight-line advantage to the car behind - and the plan was to make overtaking possible, not inevitable.Trying to balance those demands has not always been easy - sometimes overtaking has been too easy; sometimes it still is.It was only ever meant to be a temporary solution. And when the current regulations were conceived, the hope was that it could be discarded, because following would be a lot easier. It became apparent even before they were introduced in 2022 that would not be the case.Now, another rule-set has forced another solution. But it's not because DRS hasn't worked; it's because the rear wing opening has had to be added to the front wing doing something similar to balance the energy demands of the new cars with their new hybrid engines.From 2026, there will be a 'push-to-pass' system that gives an extra boost of electrical energy for the car behind. It's arguably even more artificial than DRS, and whether it will work is far from the only question hanging over the new rules.",
        "There were mixed views from F1 drivers about the new regulations when they were announced last summer.\"I have spoken to some drivers who have driven it on the simulator - I haven't - and they said it's pretty slow so we will see if it's the right direction or not,\" said Lewis Hamilton at a drivers' news conference in 2024. \"We have just got to make sure the cars are efficient, fast and a step forwards and actually racing is improved.\"McLaren's Lando Norris said: \"I guess there are reasons for it but I don't want it to go the opposite way. Especially with how complicated it is.\"You could have massive gaps and then people are going to say it's boring again. Right now it is as exciting as it has been for a very long time.\"This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.",

        "Drivers are notified via their steering wheel display when DRS is available.",
        "In practice sessions and qualifying, DRS can be used freely within the activation zones to help set faster lap times.",
        "The number of DRS zones varies by circuit - for example, Monaco has just one, while the Australian Grand Prix features four.",
        "Send us your questions",
        "DRS will be removed in 2026 as part of new Formula 1 regulations.",
        "Instead, all cars will be able to activate a low-drag mode on straights at any time, regardless of proximity to another car.",
        "Two separate power-boost modes will replace DRS on the steering wheel.",
        "'Z-mode' opens elements on the front and rear wings to increase downforce and speed through corners.",
        "Drivers can switch to 'X-mode', which reduces drag to maximise straight-line speed.",
        "These modes will be available in specific zones around each track and can be activated manually by the driver.",
        "The idea behind the DRS overtaking aid was to create a sticking-plaster solution to the problem created by aerodynamics in F1.",
        "That is, make the car's performance dependent on downforce, and overtaking will always be hard because the disruption to the airflow over a car behind another reduces its grip and makes it hard to follow closely.",
        "DRS was meant to simulate a slipstream - a straight-line advantage to the car behind - and the plan was to make overtaking possible, not inevitable.",
        "Trying to balance those demands has not always been easy - sometimes overtaking has been too easy; sometimes it still is.",
        "It was only ever meant to be a temporary solution. And when the current regulations were conceived, the hope was that it could be discarded, because following would be a lot easier. It became apparent even before they were introduced in 2022 that would not be the case.",
        "Now, another rule-set has forced another solution. But it's not because DRS hasn't worked; it's because the rear wing opening has had to be added to the front wing doing something similar to balance the energy demands of the new cars with their new hybrid engines.",
        "From 2026, there will be a 'push-to-pass' system that gives an extra boost of electrical energy for the car behind. It's arguably even more artificial than DRS, and whether it will work is far from the only question hanging over the new rules.",
        "There were mixed views from F1 drivers about the new regulations when they were announced last summer.",
        "\"I have spoken to some drivers who have driven it on the simulator - I haven't - and they said it's pretty slow so we will see if it's the right direction or not,\" said Lewis Hamilton at a drivers' news conference in 2024.",
        "\"We have just got to make sure the cars are efficient, fast and a step forwards and actually racing is improved.\"",
        "McLaren's Lando Norris said: \"I guess there are reasons for it but I don't want it to go the opposite way. Especially with how complicated it is.",
        "\"You could have massive gaps and then people are going to say it's boring again. Right now it is as exciting as it has been for a very long time.\"",
