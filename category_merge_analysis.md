### 4. **BBC Special Categories** (LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- **Option B:** Merge into "BBC Special" or "BBC Features"

**Categories:**
- Newsbeat (55) - Youth-focused news
- BBC InDepth (235) - In-depth analysis
- BBC Verify (28) - Fact-checking

**Total items:** 318 articles

**Categories to merge:**
- Climate (59)

---

### 7. **Geographic Overlap Check** (REVIEW)
**Potential overlaps to review:**
- "World" (311) vs regional categories (Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe, etc.)
- "UK" (374) vs "England" (868) - "UK" might be general UK news, while "England" is England-specific

**Recommendation:** Review articles to see if "World" is truly global or overlaps with regional categories.
